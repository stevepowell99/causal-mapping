"My younger daughter is suffering from a skin infection since three months ago. Rashes in her skin are evident and she is itching it. Despite her sickness, the health condition of my family has been well. Thanks to God she is sick but she is still alive. We care greatly for our hygiene and sanitation. We manage to keep food and water clean. There were people like you who came here and taught us how to keep our food and water clean. There is potable water in our community and we drink from it.","B1",1
"In the past three years, farming activity wasn't as productive as it used to be before. We work hard but the gain is very minimal and much less compared to what we invest. I don't know whether it is due to the climate change or the problem with the soil but the land isn't giving sufficient product. There is nothing new I started to produce, I produce what I used to produce three years ago. I have also tried to produce vegetables and fruits as per the training I got from an organization (I don't remember its name). The problem is the fruits and vegetable don't grow in dry season and it dries if there isn't enough water, so I stopped producing it. I eat different local foods and it is relatively good.","C1",2
"I engaged in petty trading of farm products. The petty trade helps me to substantiate my income so that I may buy goods needed for my household. I don't have any other income source other than petty trading activity.","D1",3
"The cost of living and increasing expenditure for purchasing food weakens our capacity and income.","E4",4

"I do my best to keep my family in good health. I clean my house to keep sanitation and I also prepare food though I'm weak. I'm feeling sick and weak; I had an operation and the operation 'reduced' my blood. Despite that I pray to my God and I try my best to keep my health. One of my children who completed his education is living in another kebele and he isn't helping me. I face financial stresses for I have to cover all the costs of my household. We have to buy drinking water from somewhere else. Both of my children have dropped out from school to look for income source to supplement our meagre income. So they are now engaged in trading.","B1",6
"The farming activity is good though it is bad this year for the whole community. The main problem with the farming is that the soil in our locality is swampy. We mainly produce teff though sometimes we produce maize. The problem with production is, it is easily taken by water since the land is swampy. I also produce cabbage and melon and the income from it is very helpful for me as I don't have a milked cow now. Other vegetables don't grow in our locality since the soil is swampy. The government agents, particularly kebele principals, gave support through distributing vegetables and fruits for planting. But we tried it and it couldn't grow in our locality but it was good for people in other kebeles. I have cattle but my two sons own oxen and two cows. One of the cows used to give us milk but now we are no more getting it. We eat well since we can purchase from market.","C1",7
"Though the income we get from farming is bad in this year it was better in the past years and there was improvement. The heavy rain resulted in flood which washed away our crops. Despite that, it has been a good harvest year in past years.","C3",8
"The trading activity is relatively better and my sons are doing well with it. They engaged in trading activity alongside the farming. You can see over there that they have ploughed the land waiting for the rain. The land will stay idle if the rain doesn't come on time.","D1",9
"We can now buy the foods from the market. My sons help with this since they are engaged in trading activity. [The trading activity is relatively better and my sons are doing well with it.]","D4",10
"In previous times everything was cheap and we could afford it with the cheap price. But now everything becomes expensive. The price of food items like maize, bean or any other crop is very expensive. So we spend much of our money on purchasing food stuffs. Whether it is flour of maize or sweet potato, any mother will buy it depending on her household size. Sometimes we have to go to the garden when we don't have cash to buy the food stuffs we want. Sometimes I have also to pay the loan my sons took from other people. My sons save in 'Shufuwa' (local association) with purpose of buying their cloth, cattle and to cover 'Masqala' (annual festival of celebrating new year). I have borrowed money for celebrating 'Masqala' festivity and I have paid back for some and I will pay other's too in near future.","E1",11
"Thanks to God, everything is fine. The government helped us to access health services like drugs, injection, chemical net, and other services that helped us to be healthy. We also take our children to health centres early if they feel sick. In the past three years we have learned to build toilets around our house and to wash our hands every time we use the toilet. We also keep our hygiene, as well as our children's hygiene, by washing clothes. Regarding drinking water, we can collect it from the kebele water source which was built by an NGO. My children attend school regularly and attentively. I also visit their teachers to know their performance at school and help them in their home study.","B1",12
"The farming has been very good and I was productive in the past three years. For example I produce about 10 quintals of teff per plot of land and I have benefited a lot from it. I also have grown maize, beans, oats and have benefited a lot. I have also got support from government through 'send organization'. I have started growing vegetables like cabbage, carrot, potato, beetroots and have benefited a lot. Send organization also gave me sheep and that helped me a lot in my life. They have also provided me with materials used for farming activity that helped me a lot to enhance my productivity. I was able to build a new house with the increased income. I have changed my life as well as my family's one. We eat well and eat different kinds of food. We consume teff, sweet potato, maize, yum and other products by purchasing as well as producing it.","C1",13
"The increased production of teff and maize, with increased price, helped us to get better income. We have also prepared the land to grow sweet potato since its yield is also significant. So improved production helped us to get better benefits.","C3",14
"We used inset for hunger season in previous times. But now we store foods like maize ahead of the coming of hungry season which starts from 5th month of the year. So producing surplus and storing food helped us to eat better during hungry season.","C5",15
"Improved farming activity that led to improved production.","C7",16
"I used to engage in petty trading in previous times. But later I started teff farming and also fattening ox to sell it for a better price. My wife is also engaged in trading activity and our income is now improving. We plan to go to urban centre to build a house and live there.","D1",17
"The increased farming activity helped me to get better income which further enhanced my trading activity. So trading is helping me to augment my income.","D4",18
"I have bought cattle like oxen, sheep and chickens. This has helped me a lot to improve my livelihood. I have cattle which I have shared (shared rearing) with other people. My diligence, with the help I got from Send organization, helped me to augment my income and to buy those assets.","E2",19
"In past three years I have learned a lot from send organization. The organization equipped us with life skills on how to work effectively, how to save money and other skills. They have also gave us seeds which helped us a lot. Their advice helped me to change my life to better.","E4",20
"I have received support from the government as well as send organization. I feel that I can further improve my life by working hard so that I will reach where other people have reached.","H2",21
"Important link to Send a Cow  - Through livelihood supports I get from it I have improved my life","I1a",22
"I have been sick in the past few years and my whole body feels weak. My elder son is also sick and that is why he dropped out of his education. Despite that, I don't face challenge in terms of getting food for consumption. I also make good care of hygiene and I teach my sons the same. We also collect drinking water from spring water since we don't have access for other potable water like from water pumps. Two of my children migrated to other areas in seeking better jobs. They have dropped out of school. Since the death of my husband it is me who is suffering a lot to win the bread for my family.","B1",23
"The farming activity is declining in productivity over time. The death of my husband also left the land abandoned, as there is no one who could care for the land. I work for share-cropping with others and they don't care for the land as I do. My elder brother who would have helped me in the farming activity has been sick for three years which adds another challenge. Yet we eat well since we can purchase the food from the market. Half of my land is covered by trees which I planted in share with others. Though the tree is one source of income, it is adversely affecting the fertility of the land. We grow yum, maize and teff which sometimes give good yield. I had cattle but I have sold them to build a new house, as the old one was deteriorated. Now I have a cow. We eat different kind of food, some of it is purchased from the market while others from my own farm field.","C1",24
"The fertility of land is declining and it is not giving good product. Many of my sons migrated to other areas due to the declining of production from the land. My daughters were also married early due to deteriorating economic situation of my family which also forced them to drop-out from school. Harvest failure is making our efforts futile.","C3",25
"The farming activity is not rewarding. Crop-failure leaves us with few food amount during bad seasons (hungry season).","C7",26
"From where do I get other income opportunity since I'm not a government employee or merchant? I myself have been fighting with my illness over the past three years, so I couldn't access other income sources. If the cow gives milk I may get some benefit. The farming yield doesn't give surplus production which I may take to market and sell. So I don't have another non-farm activity related to income earning.","D1",27
"Oh! Everything is becoming expensive and we have to spend more than ever before. The cost to meet the need of my children, visiting my daughters and others too when they give birth, everything is difficult to afford. We may have some amount of money from selling coffee in months like this (January), but the money will quickly get swept away with Masqala (new year) festivity costs, land tax, and others. I was also receiving support from a safety net  program but they excluded me from being a beneficiary when my husband died. I sold my cattle and built a new house trusting the support I would get from them (safety net) but it is about six month since I was excluded from being a beneficiary.","E1",28
"The children are young and can't help me a lot. The rest are living in other areas but they help me in sending me remittance (up to 200 or 300 birr). Those who are living with me are young and they can't help me.","F1",29
"I'm very thankful for the government. It is with the support I got from the government (safety-net program) that I built the new house. But the people who are administering the safety net excluded me as I built the house. It was a tough time for me since I had no money - as I spent it to construct the house. But the government has helped me to build the house as the safety net program save me from selling out my cattle during the first periods I stayed in the program.","J1",30
"The farming activity is good. But it is only three weeks ago since we got farming land from my husband's brother. We have ploughed it and it is ready for cropping. My husband works on a stone quarry that serves for construction activity and I also sell injera at market. So we purchase the cereals from the market, grind it and use it for a month. We also grow vegetables for home consumption. Though we don't grow crops, we eat different foods from purchasing them from the market.","C1",31
"We earn good income from the non-farm activities we both are engaged in. He gets good income from daily labour and I also earn meaningful income from the petty trade I'm engaged in. We have recently built a new iron corrugated house due to our improved income.","D1",32
"Most of our spending goes to purchasing basic necessities of food items and clothes. Though the cost is rising we can afford it due to increased income. 
My husband saves money through depositing it in shufuwa (local informal association for saving money) and I also deposit it in idir association in our locality. We didn't borrow from anyone.","E1",33
"As to my knowledge people nowadays are cooperative and work together in common affairs. They help each other in difficult times. The government also gave 'paranja kutuwa' (hybrid chicken) to people in the locality. But almost all chickens died due to 'kotuwa' (chicken epidemic) that attacked the chickens.","G1",34
"It is because of increased support from government and NGOs.","G4",35
"I gave my first birth through medical surgery which left me with continuous abdominal pain. This in turn makes it difficult to do laborious activities and affects my wellbeing. I myself will work hard to improve my livelihood in the future.","H2",36
"There is no problem with regards to the health condition of my family, thanks to God. Both me and my wife do a great deal for our children so that they won't get sick. They are healthy and regularly follow their education and support us after school. We feed them regularly, particularly on their return from school so that they won't get sick. 
We keep good hygiene and sanitation of our family. We regularly wash our clothes as well as our children's clothes. We also change our clothes before they get dirty. My wife also washes the body of the younger children regularly. Now people are changed, they keep their hygiene and sanitation very well, they eat better and sleep in better beds. Regarding drinking water we used to collect water from river. But now we drink potable water from the kebele which costs only 0.5 cents for 10 litre. Everything is now changed and even cattle drink better water.","B1",37
"The problem of rainfall and climate change is adversely affecting our farming activity starting from past three years. Sowing crop or ploughing the land isn't giving good yield. People spend more on the land but the return is very low, it can't even cover the cost. The soil is not as productive as it used to be some years ago. But this year's harvest is relatively better. This year's teff and wheat production is better as we received the rain on time. What we farmers abundantly have here in our locality is 'gadisa' (sweet potato) and 'bereket' (hybrid yum) which helped us a lot. What matters a lot is rainfall availability. So we plant crops as per seasons, whether 'Sila' (summer) and 'Gaba' (winter). For instance we have planted sweet potato in the past months and we are now preparing the land for cropping yum. People are also preparing the land for cropping maize on which they grown teff. 
Cattles are important assets for us, whose livelihood is based on farming. For example if a farmer has oxen, he can at least engage in sharecropping arrangement even if his land is fragmented. So he can earn income, get his food and send his children to school. So I own ox and use it for farming.","C1",38
"Farmers now produce good amounts and store the surplus production. The price of cereals is also better now. For example we used to sell 100 kg of teff for 1500 or 1700. But now it can be sold for 2000 or up to 2200 birr. So the income we get from farming is better now.","C3",39
"Expenditure is higher than my income due to declining fertility of land and erratic rainfall that resulted in declining yield of agricultural products. We spend on purchasing food items from the market and buying drinking water. Trading activity isn't as rewarding as it used to be in previous times. We also have to engage in social affairs where we also have to spend money. For example, we used to spend 200 or up to 300 birr for masqel festival to buy meat. But now it costs up to 1000 birr. So expenditure is increasing. We save as much as possible. Whether it is 10 or 20 birr I get from the safety net, I save it. I also have to deposit in Idir. I didn't borrow money from any one and neither of my family members did.","E1",40
"The government is making efforts to develop the kebele. The kebele currently announced that it is going to construct a new building for its office use. Send organization is also planning to construct a shop around the kebele which will serve the people. The send has been also growing teff with the people of kebele and planted trees around the river which was given for their development project.","G2",41
"Safety net program helped me a lot in improving my life. Though the amount I used to get from it was minimal, it served as initial capital in improving my livelihood. The income I got from it helped me to feed my children and to enhance my farming production.","H2",42
"The health condition of my family has been good in past three years. The only problem we are facing is declining productivity of agriculture. We don't suffer from any epidemics as we used to suffer. The heath extension has been teaching us how to keep hygiene and sanitation and we make a great deal of care concerning it. We also get potable water around here in the kebele which is constructed by World organization in 2009. My child at higher rank that is in the 10th grade follows his education regularly. But the rest face challenge due to financial stress I'm facing.","B1",43
"In the past three years the erratic rainfall has resulted in declining productivity of farming. The rainfall isn't raining based on its usual calendar and also the wind is hindering us from cropping. Even if we plant crops the rainfall may come in harvesting season which will result in total harvest failure. So the past three years have been tough for farmers in the locality.
I have cropped a seed known as 'Obama' to try in my farm field. I bought it from the market and I have realized that it can adapt to the current climate change. I don't produce cereals like teff and maize anymore due to the problem in climate condition. The kebele administrators teach us to produce vegetables like cabbage, carrot and others but we couldn't do it since the vegetables need watering regularly but we don't have irrigation in our locality. So vegetables will die soon when sunny season comes. 
In past times farming activity was good since the rainfall was good. The agricultural yield per hectare is now steadily decreasing. The land which used to give up to 5/6 quintals per hectare now won't give more than 2 quintals. Erratic rainfall is posing a challenge in terms of getting high yield. The rain is not raining regularly. Regarding cattle we are facing challenge in terms of getting fodders for cattle. The grazing land where we used to feed our cattle is now devoid of grasses due to the lack of rainfall. So our cattle are now vulnerable to various epidemics and we frequently have to bring them to medication. There are people who are near by water and use irrigation to produce vegetables. Most of the time we rely on utta (iset/False banana) for feeding. But now utta (inset) is also drying due to climate change. We used to produce and eat sweet potato, maize, and other crops. But now it is declining.","C1",44
"The climate change with heavy sun, high wind and low rainfall has contributed to the declining of our farm productivity. So we earn less income from reduced production.","C3",45
"The climate change has posed great challenge in finding enough food from our farm. So whatever we earn we spend it on purchasing food. We don't have high income that would enable us to buy property/assets.","D4",46
"We received fertilizer through credit from the government and we have to pay it back during harvest period. Land tax is another cost where we have to spend. We have also to deposit money to celebrate Masqala festival. So whatever income we get, it is not more than our costs. We have also to purchase food since the land is not as productive as it used to be. I used to actively engage in social obligations like joining friends in funerals and other ceremonies, which drained away much of my income. 
The income I get doesn't allow me to save, thus I don't have saving. The expensive cost of living doesn't allow my family to save money.","E1",47
"The cost of living is too high and we spend more than we get. So it is obvious that our ability to purchase has decreased over time.","E4",48
"I used to work as kebele chair and have served the community. I also actively participate in religious organization to which I'm member. I'm member of  Idir (self help organization) in the kebele where I deposit money. I also actively participate in social responsibilities that concern me. When we were organized to the kebele down to this area, we had access to health centre, education and other social services. But now the kebele is divided in to two and we are lacking these services.","G1",49
"People used to work on 'daguwa' (working together) where residents of kebele work together in farming activity. But now this trend is missing and people are leaving behind their farming field and migrating to urban areas in search of daily labourer work.","G2",50
"We receive good health and educational access. We used to suffer from epidemics and death. But now things are improving and we all are fine.","H2",51
"Regarding health, thanks to God that our health situation has improved over the last three years. Because health extension workers are carrying out their activities better than before and training us about the health of both children and adults. They are educating us about importance of breast feeding. We have been made aware that until the infant reaches 6 months it should not be served food, for its good health. And hence breast fed children grow healthy. Before we were trained about the health of children, our children used to suffer from different diseases. Pregnant women are also made aware to make follow up about their status beginning from fourth months after the onset of pregnancy up to sixth months. They also give birth at health institutions. Hence the health of children, pregnant women and also the health of adults has improved. They are no longer being affected by diseases such as malaria, as it was before. God is doing great things for our health through health extension workers. Regarding hygiene we were taught to keep drinking water clean. And also we have been trained to make a toilet equipped with necessary toilet materials. Now all toilets are built well and there are so many toilets built accordingly in towns. People keep water and environmental sanitation very well. We are doing well in this regard. But regarding health insurance service we do have problems. People go to hospitals to be treated in referral. However people who need to be treated through health insurance in hospitals are not being treated well. There is a delay to provide service to people who are treated through the health insurance scheme. Drinking tap water flows from Damot mountain. We have been drinking tap water flowing from damot mountain for three or four years now. It is being served in this school and we also use it for sanitation. For other activities we use well water. I have it in my compound. I lock and open to use it. Regarding water the situation is very good. Our children are following their education very well. However the complaint is that because of unknown reason a KG (kindergarten) school established by Wolaita Development Association interrupted its service. Students who started their education are affected by this. Other KG schools are not educating well. Regarding other school levels, we are being educated very well. But my question is about changing in school curricula; that is high school completion grade 10 and 12. That can affect our life. For instance, I am married and what if I fail learning in grade 12, what will I do?  Should I sit idle at home? How does the government consider this?","B1",52
"Over the past three years farming failed. I don't know whether it is related to the weather or seed. Every cultivation activity failed though there is slight improvement in this year. I don't know the reason why over the past three years there is no crop in the backyard of farmers. We sowed maize but it also failed. I don't know whether it is related to weather problem or seed. I have farm land but it is not yielding. We have not been able to use grain from our farm yard. I sowed vegetable seed that I got from Send A-Cow  Organization. It grew very well but I did not continue cultivating it because I was busy doing other things and my children are not grown up enough to help me and my husband too engaged in his works. So I stopped cultivating vegetable seeds. Vegetable seed is useful but I stopped. There is no other grain. We have almost stopped farming. Some years ago, we used to cultivate teff, wheat and maize but now the land is empty because it is not cropping season. The production decreased over the past three years may be because of weather change and rainfall related problems. Because our grazing land is taken by electricity station and school expansion, I sold all animals I had and remained only with one milked cow. Following the training from agricultural extension workers, I engaged in poultry and benefited highly from it. Poultry is different from what the rest of neighbours doing. I didn't produce anything for sale. I did never do that before even, because the production did not surpass home consumption. Previously, there were times when we did not eat our lunch after breakfast but now it is better. Now people can eat three times a day by doing anything including labour works. Now it is becoming better. I myself now can eat three times a day but previously I was struggling. I used to pass a day without any meal before. Now though there is scarcity of grain, people have money. What is your staple food? We use different products of false banana or inset from which  we prepare traditional foods such as blanduwa, uncha bacira. And also we use traditional foods such as boyna (yam) and sweat potato.","C1",53
"It increased and is better than before. The reason is not because of agricultural activity but engaging in other works (non-farm activities), including labour works that enables people to buy more food. As farm productivity has decreased, people began to engage in other livelihood activities including labour work. Now food consumption has been improved.","C5",54
"Our income depends not on petty trading but on labour work. Income based on labour work has increased compared to what it had been before. It is because the price of commodities has increased, the wage for labour has also increased. In the past three years I have engaged in poultry production to earn income. 'How you began it?'. The agricultural extension workers advised me to do so. Yes, I also used to engage in trading coffee but stopped it now. It is because I am busy in other activities such as for instance, I am a student, I look after the children and I also have house chore activities.","D1",55
"The household expenditure has increased in the past three years. The reason is because price for purchasing grain has increased. The main thing that we spend money on is to purchase grain. Yet we have started saving in kebele and other saving associations, but all are interrupted now. An organization called WONTA (Wollayita credit association) organized about twenty women where I was secretary to save money and we had been saving for long period of time but the organization stopped running its activities. The money we saved became meaningless as there is no body to follow our situation. In addition another saving organization which was established for disabled people is no more working. It is Send A Cow organization that is doing well in terms of saving. They are helping the community to own different cattle and also provide drinking water services. Others organizations stopped and the money saved become useless. Particularly an organization called WONTA (Wollayita saving association) affected us very much and there is no responsible body to question. We don't know where they are from. Once they assembled many women for training and paid 15 birr per a day and the women quarrelled over the payment. Since then they disappeared. Send A cow organization is benefitting us very much.","E1",56
"Yes, there is change. For instance, I dropped out from school while I was with my parents but I resumed it now. My ability to control and decide over property has increased. For instance, previously it was my husband who was a sole decider regarding properties and other household matters but now we consult each other. The reason is because the government protects women's rights. Now women have right and can own property, and generate income and manage their money. Previously, the men said that 'the women shouldn't manage more than 100ETB'","F1",57
"Due to my improved livelihood and support from government.","F3",58
"People work together better than before. Whether it is trading or anything else people work together through networks of 1-5 grouping and also use the network to discuss different issues.","G2",59
"It is becoming better. For instance, the government provide training about saving. As a result many people began to save their money. People have become wise.","H2",60
"Our capacity to own animals also decreased due to the loss of the common grazing land. As I am poor I own cattle in share with other rich people (engaged in share-rearing). However, the share holders took back their cattle due to scarcity of common grazing land. I wish I could rear my own but now I don't because I don't have money to buy any.","C1",61
"I am not suffering from hunger though I get nothing from my farm land. I rent-out my farm land so I use income from this together with what I earn from trading to buy food stuffs from market. For hungry season we buy maize to boil and eat it. 
We mostly eat Wollayita cultural food and we depend on the market to buy. Most of the time we eat sweat potato, Irish potato, uncha, boyna (yum). We eat all these food stuffs with similar frequency. I buy these using the profit I get from trading grains in the market. We also sometimes roast wheat. This happened before three years but now it is better. We eat now different food stuffs alternatively. Now it is better.","C7",62
"Sometimes community members gather to discuss over different issues. We discuss about both good opportunities as well as problems in our community. This trend changed in positive ways over the past three years. The reason is that people accept what is told by the officials. People also stopped blaming and insulting each other.","G2",63
"Praise the lord! There has been no health problem over the last three years. We weren't sick even before three years. Both adults and children are healthy. Our personal hygiene and environmental sanitation is very good. Me and my children are good at that. This is manifested by our health and the way we prepare and eat our food. My children wash their clothes with soap. The reason for this is that my children are literate. I buy them soap to keep their personal hygiene. Thanks to God, we keep our sanitation. We have access to tap water and also we have well water in front of our house. I dug the well water but an organization called Send A Cow came and cemented it. The well water is used for sanitation and animals. For drinking water we use tap water. Praise the lord, my children are educated well. The one in the sixth grade is attending well. I am advising him not to waste his time playing and I fulfil what he needs. I buy him books. I advise him about sanitation. I advise them to learn strongly, telling them my illiteracy not  be repeated.","B1",64
"I have small farm land. Even though I plough, its production has decreased  over the last three years. I don't know whether it is related to the problem of rainfall. I sowed different crops but they all failed. The production of farming is decreasing. Previously we used to grow corn and it used to yield good results. I also planted sweet potato, it also used to give good production, but through time both have decreased. Now it is not a period of cultivation and the farm land is already harvested. And we are praying to God for better cultivation period to come and now we are consuming 'boyna'(yam) that we planted on small plot of land during last season. Apart from this, we depend on labour work to support our life. Send A Cow organization distributed us some seeds of vegetables. I sowed it and tried to water it using the well water but it did not grow. I do not know whether this is related to the problem of the seed. Before that I had cultivated cabbage and carrot but it failed. Fruit cultivation also did not work out. We don't own cattle as we used to own before. I had an ox and two cows but I sold them. I used the money to build a house for my child in Wollayita Sodo. Some remaining animals are still under my possession.","C1",65
"I earn money hustling. And from what I get, I save in Idir (self help association mainly during funeral) for my death and life. I also save some amount of money to be used for meskel festivity (new year). In addition I save some amount to be used for clothing of my children. Now my income situation is better than before. I transport water using donkey and sell it. I began this activity over the last years and it is getting better. I have started it by my own creativity. Previously I used to engage in labour work but stopped after I started this new activity: transporting and selling water to the urban dwellers.","D1",66
"My income depends on transporting and selling water to urban dwellers using a donkey. I have no other means of getting income than this. My households ability to gain income is decreasing. It is because the living cost is different from the past, the weather condition is also different. Everything is different from what it was when I was young. Things are vanishing. My energy is also weakening.","D4",67
"The expenditure has generally increased. Especially I spend much for my children's education. Other significant expenditure is for Idir. We also spend for taxation and for our family's daily expenditure. Expenditure for children's education reduced or changed because they began to support themselves. I have a saving at neighbourhood basis that is to be used for schooling of children, their clothing and to be used for meskel festivity. I started saving this year.","E1",68
"My ability to purchase is weakening. The reason is I have problem of financial stress which is further aggravated with my aging.","E4",69
"When farming season comes we work together. And also when, in case death happens, we facilitate mourning and burial ceremonies. The way we work together is getting better because modernity is developing. I did participate and support the construction of the school in my labour. We also contributed fees for its construction. We did it last year.","G1",70
"Thank God, our health situation has improved over the last three years. It is because we keep our sanitation and hygiene well. We also treat our children properly. We eat our meals on time. We keep sanitation of children and environment. Health extension workers trained us to do so. We have tap water in the compound of the kebele but the problem is it does not meet the demand and also it is not served regularly. So we go to a distant area to fetch drinking water.","B1",71
"We have no farm land. Though we tried sharecropping arrangement, we stopped as it wasn't productive enough. Thus, we engage in other activities. My husband has another activity to do and also I engage in petty merchandise activity. Totally we have no farm land.  So we produce nothing in our backyards. We have cattle. We did not see their result yet as we  bought them recently, last year. The farming activity has been declining in past years. We used to plant boyna (yam) which would not exceed one month consumption and we also used to cultivate cabbage in our backyard. Now it is better than before because we hustle to have variety of food.  Previously, we used to eat one type of food frequently. We frequently used to eat sweet potato and boyna (yam). however, now we diversify and eat potato, corn and wheat flour and also cabbage alternatively. What we eat now is better than what it was before.","C1",72
"The income from farming decreased because it is related to variability and insufficient rainfall. The erratic rainfall, even amid the farming season, disappears when what we sow or planted has begun to bud. For instance, the wheat that we sowed failed because of the scarcity of rainfall.","C3",73
"Yes, there is good change because we embark on new income earning activity, for example, trading of coffee bean to buy food. Previously, we didn't engage in trading of coffee bean to buy food.","C5",74
"I engage in petty trade such as egg, cottage cheese, coffee bean to support our lives. We have nothing other than our market and God. My husband was jobless. I was a sole bread winner. But now we have changed in terms of our livelihood. Previously, we used to sit idle but now we earn some income. Using the income from my husband that he earned working as a foreman and from my petty trading, we bought a Bajaj vehicle. Now my husband generates income from the Bajaj vehicle.","D1",75
"It is reducing because our children are at school and we are fulfilling them what they need. We provide them pens and  exercise books. We also spend money for our social life. Now the expense is high as the household size has increased. Previously, we were alone, I and my husband, with no children.","D4",76
"No, I do not have significant possessions. What we have now is Bajaj and calf that we have possessed in the last three years.","E2",77
"Increasing expenditure with stagnant and meagre income creates financial stress.","E4",78
"People are developing good attitudes towards cooperative working. We have already school for our community. We do have also tap water in the kebele compound though it is at distant for us. Thus, we drink pump water that is near to us. Though I don't know the reason, the relationship is getting weaker. They [kebele officials] organized  30 adjacent households as one team having one leader. This further formed a group of 1-5 network. However, all this grouping and networks have been no more functional.","G4",79
"It is becoming good. The reason is we are being trained about our hygiene, toilet, food, though the awareness creation does not have consistency.","H2",80
"Farming is not as rewarding as it used to be. Farmers are losing rather than gaining. The land does not yield good result as before. The officials do not distribute fertilizer in good manner. Fertilizer is not distributed timely and also the fertilizer we bought from the market has not been productive. I am sharecropped out my land. As my husband is not with me I cannot cultivate because I am women. The problem with sharecropping is that these who share with me come latel. They come to plough the land late after they have already ploughed their own. This leads to less production at the end of the day. Had we cultivated timely it could give us good production . The production even reduced from what it had been before. The sharecroppers have no sense of ownership. Moreover, the soil fertility also decreased.  I did never sale farm products. Even it is not sufficient for my home consumption. previously we used to eat meat, cottage cheese, and butter. But now we don't. Women cannot afford to eat meat with absence of men's or husbands' financial support.","C1",81
"Income from farming has reduced from what it had been before. Because people are treacherous and the fertility of the soil has also declined and doesn't yield as before. Previously farmers had three to four stores of grain but now farmers struggle to feed themselves. Fertilizer distribution is unfair as they first distribute to rich people. Then the poor lately buy fertilizer form the market which has less quality. Thus, coupled with late seed sowing, leads to less production.","C3",82
"I engage in petty trade to raise up my children. It could be a fulfilment of the prophecy in the bible. We survive long because of what we had before. Trading activity was better before than now. Now there is less demand for merchandized goods. Thus, the money we have earned from trade has decreased.","D1",83
"The expenditure outweighs our income. If the income is 30 birr the expenditure is 60 birr. The reason is that the prices of goods that we buy from the market has increased while the income we earn couldn't increase proportionally. We spend much of our income to purchase food items. We pay for everything except house and water. I save from what I get, if I earn 20 birr, I save 10 birr from what I earn. I save it to use for medication, in case if my children get sick. Yes, I borrow money to trade and I have outstanding debt that I have to pay back.","E1",84
"Declining agricultural productivity and increasing living cost.","E4",85
"The health condition of my family is very well. I'm working as 'Bego melekitegna' (Role model) in the kebele for my good achievement and performance.  We always keep the water in the container closed. We don't suffer from diarrhoea as we used to suffer some few years ago. The white people came here and demonstrated to us how to filter water using sand and 'halakuwa' (herbal plant). My children also regularly go to school though they complain about learning in a foreign language [English] as medium of instruction.","B1",86
"The farming is good now since the past few years. We used to purchase food items from the market but now we produce from the farm. We use biogas and solar following the support we got from Omo micro-finance. So we are now leading better life. The compost we got from biogas helped us to increase the fertility of land and to reduce the cost of fertilizer. We have started producing bean which was very productive in Humbo woreda. We also produce vegetables like carrot, tomato and others getting support from Wolaita development association. The vegetables helped us to supplement our livelihood in past two years though its productivity is declining this year due to heavy heat from sun. Though some of the cattle died due to disease, I still have some more cattle. It is three people with me who are using biogas technology in our locality while the other members of the community refused to use it. The biogas is helping us to prepare food, to get light, as well as to increase fertility of the soil.","C1",87
"We eat very well, better than previous times. Many people are improving their livelihood since the Wolima organization (Wolayita development association) started intervention here. We don't suffer from hunger as we did in previous times.","C5",88
"We are using biogas, solar which enhanced our productivity. We are also using compost instead of fertilizer. So increased production helped us to eat better. We also produce vegetables.","C7",89
"We have to buy textbooks, pens and other related costs for our children. The debt for fertilizer is also another thing where we spend significant amount of money. Thanks to God, there is no such heavy thing that erodes our income. I'm also paying the debt for biogas. We save money in 'shufuw' (local inform association to save money) mainly for purpose of mesqel festival (new year). It has been three years since I started saving in Wolima organization (Wollayita development association). We save for the money that would help us to deposit some assets for our children in the future and for emergencies cases. I have borrowed money from Wolima to buy biogas.","E1",90
"I'm leader of network of 30 people. I coordinate 30 households on matter of health related issues such as on how to keep hygiene, sanitation, how to feed children and other life skills. They have chosen me because of my performance and good health condition I ensured in my family, as well as in my 1 to 5 group members, where I am also a leader.","G1",91
"Due to the community based mobilization, people better able to discuss and work together on the matters that concern them.","G4",92
"I have got biogas from Wolima that enabled me to avoid fertilizer loan. The saving and credit services has also helped me to improve my livelihood.","H2",93
"I hope that I can improve my livelihood in the future. I came to learn new things as I worked with the send a cow organization. Send a cow organization took me to Hawassa where I learned about saving. For example I went to the Amahara region where I witnessed people who started saving with 25 and 50 cents and now accumulated 25 birr and above. So I hope that I will improve my life and also teach others about saving, sanitation and other issues.","H3",94
"Important link to Send a Cow - learned about saving, help me to learn new skills so as to improve my livelihood.","I1a",95
"Though we are frequently getting sick, thanks to God we are still alive. There are people who were fine but suddenly died for unknown reasons. So I'm thankful to my God that we are still alive. The health workers also taught us about the  importance of keeping sanitation and hygiene. So we have built a toilet and we don't defecate in an open field. We have also come to learn that if there is garbage in our house it would host flies and then the flies would contaminate the food. The contaminated food would cause many diseases, so we avoid leaving the food uncovered. We don't also put the food items on the ground. We usually fetch water from Litala river but sometimes we buy from tap water. We always keep the jar containing drinking water in a clean place.","B1",96
"We have a small plot of land where we do our farming activity. We produce different crops like maize, teff, wheat, sweet potato from our farming land. We also consume 'inset' (false banana) in difficult times. We also produce vegetables whose production is enough for home consumption but not surplus for market. Though we don't get support from government as other people do, we are improving our livelihood through our effort. Regarding cattle, I have received chickens from send organization which helped me a lot. I have also  cattle which I own in share with other people. I had also a cow which used to give milk but I sold it to cover health expense of my son who was severely sick and unfortunately died in the meantime. We eat different foods as much as we can.","C1",97
"The farming activity is now better than previous times though it was bad during the last harvest season due to unavailability of rainfall on time. However, this year it is better as the rain rained at its regular time. So I hope we are going to collect better income from farming. Thus, the income we get from farming is improving as the production became good.","C3",98
"The income we get is not as good as our effort. But my child who was chronically ill made us suffer from financial stress and reduced our ability to purchase property. We had sold our assets to treat him.","D4",99
"Most of the time, we spend our money to purchase food items. Sometimes we have borrowed money to cover our expenditure. I save money in different places including in: Idir, send organization, and wachiga saving and credit development association that funds orphan children. I also deposit money in the church where I am a member. I have also borrowed money from saving association as well as from people.","E1",100
"Sometimes it gets improved and sometimes it gets decreased. Vegetables are not as productive as they used to be. I have also to pay the debt of fertilizer. The sickness of my child and later his death obliged me to spend more in expensive funeral ceremony that eroded my financial base. Thus, I have outstanding debit that I have to pay back.","E4",101
"In the last three years there has been a change in our health. We are keeping our environment clean according to awareness creation given by health officers. In addition to health workers, WODA is also teaching us to protect our health and our environment through managing solid wastes and avoiding conditions which led to malaria problem. There is change in our health, malaria is not frequently occurring like before, we have our independent toilet and shower. We are keeping our health through washing our hands, our bodies every three days, our clothes and also washing all our utensils before and after using it. We got awareness from the NGO send a cow. The organization had taught us to keep our environment clean and to protect ourselves from various communicable diseases. With regard to clean and potable water, we lack clean water near our community. Thus, we are getting it from a far community, which is one of the challenges that we are facing. 
In relation with education, I am motivating and helping my children to learn actively in their level of education. One of my daughters is very strong in her education and she is a rank student. She is now learning in Gesuba secondary school. I experiment with the so called biogas which provides light and it became effective; it helped my children to study and read daily without any challenge. In addition to my follow up and their commitment, the existence of biogas in my home has played significant role on my children's education.","B1",102
"We are eating a variety of foods that we can get from our farm mainly cereals, inset and inset products. We have improvement in our health and we are taking varieties of food because of the change in our life. The reason for overall change and improvement is agriculture and agricultural productivity has increased. This is because of my commitment in farming and the way of farming is improved; cultivating according to seasons; when and where agriculture is effective. Other than farming, cattle rearing is another activity that changed my life. Cattle rearing plays a vital role in improving the life of rural dwellings.","C5",103
"In last three years the food we eat and its quality is also improved. Nowadays we are not hit by drought. There is good change in my life because of effective farming, commitment to farming based on seasons; when, where, what to cultivate to increased the yield of farming. This enabled us to get better food and to be free from drought which occured frequently before.","C7",104
"In the last three years, what I get non-farming income from is from beehives or apiculture. Every year in October and May I spend my time working on creating conducive conditions for bee to produce honey. I am producing honey and getting good income from honey, selling it for 90-120 birr per/kg. Other activity from which I get income is fattening of oxen, mainly when they get tired/aged. I sell out the fattened one and replace it with young oxen and get good profit out of it. 
I am producing honey because of my own commitment, without any technical or financial support. Generally, my income has increased not only from agriculture but also from apiculture and fattening. Even the income I earn only from honey and honey product covers all my expenditures including land tax and all home expenditures.","D1",105
"In the last three years one of the expenditure that we spend is for fertilizers called DAP and urea. When we sell our agricultural products we calculate the cost and profit. The cost of what we spend is mainly the cost of fertilizer; most probably it is around 2600 ETB. Other expenditure will be health treatment cost, sometimes when we feel sick we have to go to health centres. Expenditure of fertilizer is the main spending that we have. Our spending of fertilizer is getting higher due to the increase of  price of fertilizer year after year. Therefore, expenditure is also increased.
With regard to a culture of saving, a year ago I was saving independently in my home. Now I am joined community saving association initiated by send a cow NGO and I am cashier in the saving association. We have started saving for 5 birr contribution. When the progress is promising we made our contribution to 10 birr. Our saving association also provides credit service for those who are members of the association and creditor is expected to pay interest based on the rate of credit. An individual who borrows 1000 birr is expected to pay interest of 150 birr.  We accumulated around 29000 birr in our association. The community members can borrow this money from the association to solve their pressing problems. The organization bought a truck and awarded us seeing our commitment to support our association. We are using this truck to transport  products from rural area to urban area. The organization has encouraged us to continue saving and to invest it to start different trading activities. We have also a plan to open up a common shop in the near future. 
In last three years in general, there is improvement in our life the community members can easily get credit from saving association when we face some problem. A member can get credit easily just paying expected interest. No one is expected to go through different bureaucratic procedure and beg individuals to get credit as it was before. This is one of the changes in our life.","E1",106

"The relationship and decision in the household is good. I am as a leader of my family and orient what is to be done, who is responsible for household activities, who will take care after children and other similar activities. We also discuss together. There is change in this aspect, it is because we had lessons from health extension workers about the way of living as well as  the importance of peaceful and clear communication among family members.","F1",108
"There is a change in the way the community works and collaborate together. I am the leader of 1-5 grouping and  I am participating in community road construction and community development projects. Thus, the community participates and works together through mobilization of 1 to 5 network. Moreover, since a year ago I am serving as community leader as the community members believe and accept me because of my character I show in the community.","G2",109
"There is cooperation and collaboration among community members. We are working together in the time of farming and cultivating our land. We are working in group of five or more than that in different seasons. We are discussing on the issues which are controversial, to solve problems and conflicts together in the community through discussion and dialogue. With regard to development project in the community, different governmental and non-governmental organizations are working and creating awareness to the community. But there are different type of people are living in the community and all people cannot work equally; one may be lazy, other may be careless, other may be not interested on the issue. This is the challenge for cooperation in community development. Having this all challenges that there is change in the community and that the community is better than before. There is dialogue, discussion, grouping and working together. Except certain individuals having their personal behaviour there is nothing which restricts dialogue and community development.","G4",110
"There is change in all aspects of my family life. There is better change in our community that the community is discussing on various social issues and discuss to avoid some harmful traditional cultures. The community is participating spiritually in church, in social associations like Idir and the people outcasts individuals who have unethical behaviour.","H2",111
"Important link to Send a Cow - Have received Training, biogas- improved livelihood","I1b",112
"In the last three years, personally, there is no change in agricultural production. There has been a reduction in agricultural production because we owned small plot of land which is only for subsistence. The weather condition in this season has limited our agricultural production. There is no change in agricultural production mainly becuse of lack of land for farming. We are working on others land and divide the production equally with the owner of the land. Thus the production is not surplus for home consumption. 
With regard to varieties of production, there are no new crops that we have produced now but have not produced before. There is no vegetable and fruits, we just have a small plot on which we grow some crops for home consumption.
With regard to livestock we had two oxen before, but now we sold one of them for house construction, so we are now left with one. What makes us different from the community is that, our community members have large plots of land but we have small; so the option we have is working on others land through sharcropping. We sharecrop in only 1/3 hectar of land as we don't have any other options to do.","C1",113
"In the last three years things are becoming very expensive. We spend to have what is required for household members, mainly for our children. Our life is full of expense. We don't have any source of income but we have various expenditures. The expenditure is increasing overtime time because things are becoming very expensive. However, we don't formally register our expenditures but we have different spending for household needs.
In the last three years we don't save either at home or in any on the saving association. Let alone saving we borrowed different amount money from individuals and we also have outstanding debit for fertilizer. It is difficult for us when  the production is getting low. We are not participating in any type of saving. Based on our current situation saving is unimaginable.","E1",114
"There is no change from the income of agriculture because it requires follow up and fertilizer. My husband has already died, I am not farming and the land is provided to other via contract. I lack financial capacity to invest in agriculture. Therefore, agriculture production is decreasing after three years because of the above reason I mentioned and the existing weather condition. I have fruits like mango, from which I get some income. In relation with livestock, I have only one shared with other person.","C3",115
"In last three years no good change is witnessed in my life rather it has become worse in these three years. It is because of my husband's death. Farming is not providing the yield. In general, there is no change in income.","D4",116
"In the last three years my main expenditure is when I feel sick and my children feel sick for medical treatment. I have spent a significant amount of money in the last three years for health problems and death of my husband. I borrowed money from others for my daily consumption as well as for land tax.","E1",117
"The overall wellbeing is not in the good condition. It is bad. I sometimes feel sick physically. The condition is becoming worse in this last three years.","H2",118
"In the last three years our health condition is good and we have good health. We are trying our best under the help of God and protecting our health in washing our body, our clothes, and our kitchen materials. We are practicing the lesson that we acquired from the health workers and other non-governmental organizations. We are also getting clean water though it is far from our surrounding. The challenge is, it is far from our community and the water around our community is not functional, rather it is under maintenance.
","B1",119
"In the past three years agricultural product is declining because of the fluctuation of weather condition that becomes unpredictable. We are working hard, DA's are striving their best but the fluctuation and unpredictability of weather has reduced our agricultural product. I am really shocked because of the weather condition. I consider that it is God who is responsible for this but no one could accuse God for what is happening. As fulfilment of God's word, it is an approach of the end of the world. That is why things will go in such manner. 
I have small plot of land and most of the time I work in share with others and also sharecropped-in land to get some benefit. I began to produce cassava this year in order to diversify my agricultural produce. Regarding fruits and vegetables, since this area is desert I am not producing it. Moreover, to produce vegetables we need water but we don't have sufficient water and also have lack of experience to produce it. Our land is also not fertile and the agro-ecological condition is not suitable for vegetable and fruit production. There are people in our locality who tried to produce vegetables with the support they got from send organization but the final result was not significant.
With regard to livestock, we don't have to many livestock due to lack of grazing area. We rather engaged in chicken production in place of herding livestock even though it is not that much effective. The agro-ecology in this area is not good for poultry production.","C1",120
"As I stated earlier, in this three years our agricultural productivity is reduced. this is mainly due to unpredictable weather condition. There is no source of income for us. An individual in our community earn income only fattening their livestock. Once they sell they get some profit to buy another ox.","D4",121
"During the last three years my main expenditures include fertilizer, annual festival ceremonies, land tax, and educational material for my children. In the last three years expenditure has increased due to high market price while income is decreased due to low agricultural production related to weather conditions.
With regard to saving I am trying to save as much possible; not only in cash but also in kind. I am saving/storing agricultural produce for the drought time. However, the weather condition worsens and is a challenge. Thus with such context, it is difficult to save and my saving is not progressing as I wish.","E1",122
"There is change and improvement in our community in last three years. The community is working through discussion and cooperation. I feel that through dialogue and collaboration we can change our community. This is because we are concerned for our community and solve our community problem in collaboration with government and NGO.","G4",123
"In the last three years, my family is in good health. In terms of health, things have been improved a lot since the establishment of health care centre in the nearby village. We can easily access health services like getting injections, and other medicine whenever one of my family members does not feel good. Some of my kids are enrolled in school but not all of them. Two of my kids dropped out of school. I want them to go school. Thanks to government efforts, we have primary as well as secondary schools in our village. But you know kids of these days do things as they wish. There is a good deal of improvement in terms of access to clean water for drinking and other household purpose. The government built water pipe. There is also an organization called ""sendika"" which helped me with planting water well. Water well was drilled to extract water. As result, we have no problem with getting clean water for drinking and other uses.","B1",124
"In the last three years, I used to grow and harvest teff, wheat, maize, and potatoes for consumption. I do my best to grow variety of crops though the size of my farmland is small. Currently, I mainly produce potatoes but I could not produce more of everything. The amount of production of these crops varies from year after year depending on the weather condition. Climate change is affecting our farming production. Sometimes the weather gets better, sometimes it gets worse. I am harvesting less and less as result of bad weather condition. Moreover, I couldn't  grow and produce more because of the small farming land size. Thus, the small land size does not allow me to sow variety of crops. I could not also own large of number of cattle because of small grazing land. I have one milk cow and one sheep. Of course, I have rented land from others to produce more crops, but it is my other occupation as carpenter that helps me to support my family. Our neighbours grow and harvest much more than us because they have large farming land. They managed to grow and harvest a variety of crops like wheat, maize, teff, and barely.  Mine is very small. There are no new activities I have taken up in order to produce more food crops.","C1",125
"Besides farming activities, I have additional income from other activities like carpentry, water-well digging. My incomes from non-farming activities coupled with farming activities helped me to improve my family life. But income from farming alone is not that promising. It the income from non-framing activities that is very helpful","D1",126
"I have been spending more and more money for 'Idir' (traditional saving institution). I am member of several 'Idir'. So I have to contribute a good deal of money. Moreover, I have spent more money for my kid's education. In the past three years, I have been spending money to buy them stationary, clothes/outfit and shoes. I have also been saving in kind.  I am member of in-kind saving team. We save 'iron sheet' that helps in building house. I have debt which is to be paid sometimes in future. But this change is good because there are improvements in our life. In the last three years, I managed to build new house.","E1",127
"We have good relationship with our neighbours and entire community. The community has a good culture of working together. When it is rainy season, we used to help each other in harvesting, weeding and doing agricultural works in one another's farm. In the last three years, I have been involved in various community level activities such as road repairing and other development activities. For example, here, the local school has been growing potatoes with the help of the organization called 'sendika'. Last time, we have helped the school with harvesting and weeding crops. It is common that the community come together to carry out certain activities during summer season.","G1",128

"In the last three years, our health condition is getting better and better. My family pays 200 birr per year in order to secure health insurance. We have been provided with health insurance documents. So we have access to health care services for free since we have already paid the yearly premium. Previously, we have been struggling with sending our children to schools because of lack of educational facilities on nearby village, but now they moved to our place following construction of school in places nearby our village. With respect to education, things are much better than the previous years. In addition, health extensions have been educating us a lot about hygiene and sanitation practices. However, getting clean water is not easy for us. We don't have sufficient water for drinking and other household use.  We are also struggling to cope up with urban life when it comes to getting sugar and oil from the city council. This place has been urbanized. In addition, Sorfela (wide area of pasture) where our goats and sheep used to graze had been taken away by government due to urbanization. That affected us negatively.","B1",131
"We have been producing maize, beans and peas. In addition, we have been growing vegetable, cabbage and fruits with support of organization called 'Sendika'. 'Sendika' give us seeds of cabbage, carrot and other vegetables. They also educate us to grow vegetables. However, in the last three years, we are producing crops in lesser in quantity. Especially, we produce maize in lesser quantity compared to the previous years. As a result, we have been impoverished. We are no longer getting fertilizer from the Kebele. We don't have many cattle because finding pasture land where our cattle graze becomes difficult. We have one ox, milk cow and sheep. Previously, the Kebele has given us improved seeds of wheat and peas once we buy fertilizer from the Kebele. We have also given seeds of potatoes from the kebele.  However, that is no longer the case. The kebele ceased to give us seeds as well as fertilizer. Similarly, two years ago, 'Sendika' has been giving us seeds of variety of vegetable. The vegetable seeds helped us a lot. Since last year, 'Sendika' is no longer providing us support.","C1",132
"The reasons are basically attributed to bad weather condition, and wrong use of fertilizer. We have used fertilizer but it did not help. Previously, we have been producing abundantly. Hence, we used to have surplus crops for market. However, in the last three years, we don't even have enough crops for household consumption.","C3",133

"In the last three years, things have been improved a lot with respect to health. We also have access to clean water because of construction of water pipes in our village. Health care facilities provide quality health services compared to the old days. Moreover, hygiene and sanitation practice has also been improved due to team works arranged by government.

He pays a visit during holidays.  He works there. I have been growing vegetables. Currently, I am producing beans in lesser quantity. I mainly produce for household consumption. However, farming activity is not promising. The small size of my farmland coupled with lack of ox prevented from being productive. Previously, I have been working hard on my farmland but not anymore. I get sick so I couldn't do agricultural activities. So, framing activities has been weakening in the given period. However, my family life has been improved because of my trading activities.","C1",136

My family is in good health during the last three years. The government has also given us mosquito nets. So, we are able to prevent malaria. However, there is a serious problem in relation to clean water. I don't have access to clean water. My family often struggle to get water for drinking and other use.","B1",140
"I have small farmland. I have been growing sweet potatoes, potatoes, teff, and wheat. This year, I have stopped growing maize because of fearing crop disease related to maize. However, the amount of production has been diminished due to bad weather condition. Last year, I have bought cabbage, carrot and other vegetables from people who are involved with 'Sendika' organization. I have bought vegetables for household consumption. I also own cattle jointly with other neighbour. I have two cows and one ox.  I have also started doing business so as to support my family because farming activity is not going well. Most of the crops like teff, wheat and sweet potatoes I have planted have lost during the last year. In previous years, I have been producing maize for household consumption. I am no longer collecting crops from my own farm for household consumption. Nowadays, we buy most of our food items from the market. Others in my neighbourhood are doing better than me because their farming land is lager in size hence; they managed to have increased production of crops over the past three years.","C1",141

Once upon a time, I have visited traditional healers because health care centre doesn't treat me well. One of my kids doesn't often feel well. However, the health care centre here does not help us. On the other hand, all my kids are attending schools. I am sending all of my kids to school. We don't have clean water within safe physical reach. We sometimes struggle to get clean water for drinking and other uses. There are some people in our neighbourhood who have water wells planted by the organization called 'Sendika'. However, they don't allow us to fetch water from their well. They use water to drink, grow vegetables and other crops. So, we have to take a long walk to fetch water from villages far away from us. My family hygiene and sanitation practices get better during this period due to health extension work.","B1",147
"Farming activity has been disappointing because of bad weather conditions. I have been producing maize, teff, peas and beans. Recently, I am producing more potatoes, and less teff. I stopped growing maize because of crop disease. I couldn't  grow vegetables because I don't have adequate water. Those people who have been linked to the organization called 'Sendika' grow vegetables, and they also have water well in their vicinity.

This helped us a lot. Previously, our children have to go to other town to pursue their education. But that is no longer the case.","B1",151
"In the last three years, my farming production goes down because of expropriation of my farmland for development project, i.e. building school. I have been given substitute land but it is not as fertile as the original one. As a result, it affected the amount of farming production. Now, I am producing coffee, fruit and false banana products. Previously, I used to produce abundantly so as to sell out in market. However, that has been changed over this period since the expropriation of my farmland. The farmland which has been given in substitute is not productive. Moreover, I don't own large livestock because of lack of pasture land. I have sold my livestock after expropriation of my farmland.  Currently, I have one ox and one cow.","C1",152
"Previously, we used to produce in higher quantity. Our previous farmland has been so fertile so we were able to produce surplus crops for market in order to earn money. Thus, we got huge profit. Over the last three years, our income from farming decreased due to expropriation of fertile land. Our current land is not that fertile so we don't grow and harvest as old times. That change affected our household income a lot.","C3",153

We did not make any significant purchase or investment during the last three years.","E1",156

However, things have been improved a bit over the last three years. He is financially struggling since the expropriation of our farmland. But that is good because he becomes humble.","F1",157
"In the last three years, things have been improved a lot in term of health, hygiene and sanitation because of intensive works by Wolaita Development Association (WDA). WDA has been educating us about health, hygiene and sanitation. We have built toilet since then. Moreover, WDA has imparted information about health issues, and eating nutritious food. WDA helped us to grow vegetables like carrot, cabbages, red potatoes, tomatoes and others over the last three years. The health information we received from WDA has helped us a lot. Thanks to their effort, we are able to save in cash. With regard to education, all of my children have been attending schools. The problem is we don't have high schools (9th-12th Grade) around. So, I have been forced to send my children to other town such as Sodo and Gassuba. That is very difficult for me because I am not financially able to do so. As result, some of my children dropped out of school at some point. But most of them have been enrolled at school. On the other hand, we have serious problem in relation to getting water. We often fetch water from remote places. So we don't have access to clean water.","B1",158

Over the last three years, the production amount goes down. The market return of my farming product is low so I couldn't cover the costs related to fertilizer. In addition to this, physical disability on my hand reduced my productivity. I cannot work on my farm instead I have to hire someone who works on my land. I have been producing maize and peas. Last year, I have produced vegetables for household consumption. There are no new activities I have taken up in the last three years. We have been eating the same things during this period. I have milk cows. I have also jointly owned an ox with my neighbour. WDA has given me hens. I have been saving at WDA so I managed to own poultry.","C1",159
"During the last three years, farming production has been decreased due climate change. Moreover, the physical disability hindered me from working intensively in the farming land. I have to rent my land to other able man due to my disability. That reduced my income and affected the amount of food my household eats during this period.","C5",160
