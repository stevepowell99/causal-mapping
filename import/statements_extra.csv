But the problem is that people do it individually and also won't come on time (to the appointment to work together).

282,Does anyone in the household have a chronic illness or disability?,No
283,Please tell me about any changes in the health of your household during this period.,"There is no problem with regards to the health condition of my family, thanks to God. Both me and my wife do a great deal for our children so that they won’t get sick. They are healthy and regularly follow their education and support us after school. We feed them regularly, particularly on their return from school so that they won’t get sick. 
We keep good hygiene and sanitation of our family. We regularly wash our clothes as well as our children's clothes. We also change our clothes before they get dirty. My wife also washes the body of the younger children regularly. Now people are changed, they keep their hygiene and sanitation very well, they eat better and sleep in better beds. Regarding drinking water we used to collect water from river. But now we drink potable water from the kebele which costs only 0.5 cents for 10 litre. Everything is now changed and even cattle drink better water."
284,"Overall, how has the income your family earns from farming changed during the past three years?",Improved
285,What is the main reason for any change?,Farmers now produce good amounts and store the surplus production. The price of cereals is also better now. For example we used to sell 100 kg of teff for 1500 or 1700. But now it can be sold for 2000 or up to 2200 birr. So the income we get from farming is better now.
286,Over the past three years do you think that the amount of food that your household eats during the hungry season has…,Increased
287,What is the main reason for any change?,What people eat in hungry season depends on the preparation they made previously.

291,"Please tell me how your ability as a household to earn money and/or payment in kind from non-farming activities has changed in the last three years, if at all.","Sometimes I may get 50 or 60 birr for daily labouring and this will help me in supplementing my expenditures on 'masqel' (new year) festival, idir and other expenditures. Along with the crop farming, cattle rearing is another option for us. If a farmer owns a cow he may use the milk to feed his children or to sell it at the market. But trading activity is not as rewarding as it used to be. So daily labouring is a good source of non-farm income for us."
292,Overall how has the amount you earn as cash or in kind income as a household changed over this time?,No change
293,"Overall, how do you feel your household’s ability to control/choose the way your household earns income has changed?",No change

301,"Please tell me how your relationships with others living in this community have changed during the period, if at all.","We participate in various affairs of the community that concern us. For example, if I have to stay and work at farming, my son will go to the safety net program. We actively engage in all social obligations in our locality too."
302,Do you feel that there has been any change in the way people in the community work together?,The government is making efforts to develop the kebele. The kebele currently announced that it is going to construct a new building for its office use. Send organization is also planning to construct a shop around the kebele which will serve the people. The send has been also growing teff with the people of kebele and planted trees around the river which was given for their development project.
303,Overall how do you feel that community relations and decision-making have changed over the past three years?,Better
304,What is the main reason for any change?,The government has been mobilizing people to develop themselves and other organizations are also helping it.

343,What is the main reason for any change?,It is due to climate change that the amount of food my household eats during hungry season is decreasing. In past times we produced sweet potato and inset that enabled us to cope with the hunger. But now lack of rainfall is creating a challenge to produce these crops.
344,"Overall, during this period do you think that the quality and/or variety of food that your household eats during the hungry season has…",GOT WORSE
345,What is the main reason for any change?,Lack of rainfall which leads to declining productivity from farming.
346,"Please tell me how your ability as a household to earn money and/or payment in kind from non-farming activities has changed in the last three years, if at all.",There is no other income source than selling agricultural products in the market. Though the profit isn’t rewarding I sell some cereals in market to cover my expenditures such as land tax and Masqala festival.

355,What is the main reason for any change?,"If the government had mobilized the community we could have changed our life.

392,Please tell me about any changes in the health of your household during this period.,"Regarding health, thanks to God that our health situation has improved over the last three years. Because health extension workers are carrying out their activities better than before and training us about the health of both children and adults. They are educating us about importance of breast feeding. We have been made aware that until the infant reaches 6 months it should not be served food, for its good health. And hence breast fed children grow healthy. Before we were trained about the health of children, our children used to suffer from different diseases. Pregnant women are also made aware to make follow up about their status beginning from fourth months after the onset of pregnancy up to sixth months. They also give birth at health institutions. Hence the health of children, pregnant women and also the health of adults has improved. They are no longer being affected by diseases such as malaria, as it was before. God is doing great things for our health through health extension workers. Regarding hygiene we were taught to keep drinking water clean. And also we have been trained to make a toilet equipped with necessary toilet materials. Now all toilets are built well and there are so many toilets built accordingly in towns. People keep water and environmental sanitation very well. We are doing well in this regard. But regarding health insurance service we do have problems. People go to hospitals to be treated in referral. However people who need to be treated through health insurance in hospitals are not being treated well. There is a delay to provide service to people who are treated through the health insurance scheme. Drinking tap water flows from Damot mountain. We have been drinking tap water flowing from damot mountain for three or four years now. It is being served in this school and we also use it for sanitation. For other activities we use well water. I have it in my compound. I lock and open to use it. Regarding water the situation is very good. Our children are following their education very well. However the complaint is that because of unknown reason a KG (kindergarten) school established by Wolaita Development Association interrupted its service. Students who started their education are affected by this. Other KG schools are not educating well. Regarding other school levels, we are being educated very well. But my question is about changing in school curricula; that is high school completion grade 10 and 12. That can affect our life. For instance, I am married and what if I fail learning in grade 12, what will I do?  Should I sit idle at home? How does the government consider this?"
393,"Overall, how has the income your family earns from farming changed during the past three years?",Got worse
394,What is the main reason for any change?,The income decreased over the past three years. I don't know the reason why but the income has decreased.

He passed away leaving me alone with little children. There is no body who follows up and ploughs the land. Even if I could get someone to help, I don't have an ox for ploughing. Also I don't have a cow, so from where I could get milk? Someone gave me his cow for share rearing but in the meantime he took it back as I faced problem of grazing land. Once officials gathered poor people and promised to help us but even though we publicized our poverty they didn't help us. It has been 13 years since my husband died. Since then God helped me. I did not look for another husband. I sell flour in the market, I depend on this income to help my children. Thanks to God, none of my children have been sick or died. Though I have never been helped so far, I anticipate something from you. The fact that you approached us to know about our problem, let alone giving us something. I have seven children, thanks to God, and none of them have died or been sick since my husband passed away. One of my children now is in a university. The second eldest child is attending his education at Debremarkos University. If it is the will of God he will graduate this year. I have received no aid/support from the kebele even though there are employees who receive monthly salary but are still helped by the kebele. Support that targeted to the poor is passed to and given to employees. Jobless women and men alike go to Addis Ababa in search of work putting their educational certificates at home. They migrate to Addis Ababa in order not to be a burden to their fathers and mothers who paid sacrificically to educate them. They end up as daily labourers in Addis Ababa locking up their education certificates in the box. How long since this happened? This began to happen since the formation of government. I can’t finish telling you the story now. We tried to help our life through share rearing of cows.  We used to rear our cattle on communal land but now there is no communal land and hence the owners of cows take their cows back. The government did nothing for us after taking our communal grazing lands. I keep my compound and my house clean. Because of this there is no disease at my home, neighbourhood and the community. My health is very good. The government provided us with tap water that we use, although it has problems related to payment. I personally have well-water in my compound. It was dug when my husband was alive. I pull out the water manually. An organization helped me to build it. 
Regarding education a child is attending a university education, one is in seventh grade, the other dropped out from six grade because I couldn’t support him. Then he worried and stopped."

Now people are disobedient to each other I can’t do that now. People hustle and trade to change their lives so they are not willing if you call them to gather for common issues. People stay up to 9:00 am at market places. People engage in trading activity so that they are unwilling to meet and waste their time."

Even though I plough, its production has decreased  over the last three years. I don’t know whether it is related to the problem of rainfall. I sowed different crops but they all failed. The production of farming is decreasing. Previously we used to grow corn and it used to yield good results. I also planted sweet potato, it also used to give good production, but through time both have decreased. Now it is not a period of cultivation and the farm land is already harvested. And we are praying to God for better cultivation period to come and now we are consuming 'boyna'(yam) that we planted on small plot of land during last season. Apart from this, we depend on labour work to support our life. Send A Cow organization distributed us some seeds of vegetables. I sowed it and tried to water it using the well water but it did not grow. I do not know whether this is related to the problem of the seed. Before that I had cultivated cabbage and carrot but it failed. Fruit cultivation also did not work out. We don’t own cattle as we used to own before. I had an ox and two cows but I sold them.

When we become sick of malaria we go to health stations. However, the service we get from health stations is not as urgent as we need. Thus we mostly go to private health clinics. While adults or children visit the government health stations, the nurses couldn't treats the patient as fast as possible. They say 'we are for coffee break, eating our lunch' or say other things that delay the services. Thus, we prefer to go to private clinics even though we have shortage of money. The health station is near but its service isn’t a quality one. The other problem is that even if they [health professional in the health station] have medicine in their store, they prescribe us it from outside. They focused on questioning and urge us whether we have paid health insurance rather than treating the patient. As my husband lives in another place, I could not afford to pay health insurance alone. We keep clean our children’s clothes though they are tattered. There is no difference about hygiene over the last three years. We have problem of drinking water especially during dry season. During rainy season we use well water. We go to distant area to fetch drinking water. Moreover, during the dry season there are a high number of individuals who are using this water that make it difficult to access it. About ten kebeles use this water.

If I want to make significant purchases to possess some assets, I am expected to spend much time, energy and money. If that is the case, my children would starve while I focus on the outside activity for money and I don’t want this to happen.

768,Has anything changed in the way you farm for home consumption or income in the last three years?,"With regard to farming, in the last three years I had got my own grain store, locally called ‘Gotera’, a store harvest. I had two oxen for farming and I farm independently without asking others for oxen. I am producing teff, maize and other cash crops. Unfortunately this year teff has low yield in the community, though I had got better product from teff. This year, in order to  diversify my agricultural productions I had begun to produce cassava for the first time. Generally, there is a change in production and consequently this increased my income. This is the result of  my struggle. I am competing with others and trying to change my life seeing how others are progressing and changing their life from rural area to urban cities. I am committed to change my life and want to transform from rural life to urban life as my friends did. 
With regard to vegetables and fruits, we are not experienced with such kind of products (fruit and vegetable production) as our community has a problem of water shortage. Therefore, I am not producing fruits and vegetables. I am producing cash crops like maize and teff. But earn a significant income from apiculture. I have around 38 beehives. This sector is the base for my diversification of agricultural activities. 
In relation with livestock I have different livestock such as cow, beef and oxen. I have milked cows from which my family is getting milk and milk products. I also fatten beefs and sell for a good price when the market price rises. I do a  market survey in advance and sell the fattened beef in a market where the price is high. Generally, there is change and improvement in my life and my family life. What makes me different from others is I am saving and I am not an extravagant person, I sell my cattle and beef as per my plan. I sell it out when the market price is good and planed for purpose.
Regarding production for home consumption and income, I am producing maize, teff and sorghum for market while cereals for home consumption. I am selling maize in April and June when the market price rises; it is not sold before this period. Other products will be sold when there is good market."

We are trying our best under the help of God and protecting our health in washing our body, our clothes, and our kitchen materials. We are practicing the lesson that we acquired from the health workers and other non-governmental organizations. We are also getting clean water though it is far from our surrounding. The challenge is, it is far from our community and the water around our community is not functional, rather it is under maintenance.
"
933,Has anything changed in the way you farm for home consumption or income in the last three years?,"In the past three years agricultural product is declining because of the fluctuation of weather condition that becomes unpredictable. We are working hard, DA’s are striving their best but the fluctuation and unpredictability of weather has reduced our agricultural product. I am really shocked because of the weather condition. I consider that it is God who is responsible for this but no one could accuse God for what is happening. As fulfilment of God's word, it is an approach of the end of the world. That is why things will go in such manner. 
I have small plot of land and most of the time I work in share with others and also sharecropped-in land to get some benefit. I began to produce cassava this year in order to diversify my agricultural produce. Regarding fruits and vegetables, since this area is desert I am not producing it. Moreover, to produce vegetables we need water but we don't have sufficient water and also have lack of experience to produce it. Our land is also not fertile and the agro-ecological condition is not suitable for vegetable and fruit production. There are people in our locality who tried to produce vegetables with the support they got from send organization but the final result was not significant.
With regard to livestock, we don't have to many livestock due to lack of grazing area. We rather engaged in chicken production in place of herding livestock even though it is not that much effective. The agro-ecology in this area is not good for poultry production."
