"In my view the main factor to success relies on the the council prioritising this extension over other planned cycling routes.  NS council are currently working on multiple cycling schemes across the whole county, which is a good thing, however they only have limited time, resources and money. Therefore our role needs to focus on activities such as petition, raising awareness and local support, continued pressure on the council to increase focus & priority on this extension above others. Once the extension is in place it will have multiple positive effects on the local communities in both Yatton and Clevedon. By offering a safe cycling route it will open up access for Clevedon residents to the train station, it will encourage residents of both towns to have more options for local leisure activities with their family instead of having to get in the car, it will increase fitness and well being of local residents, will bring more business revenue into both towns as people will stay local and it will have a positive effect on the environment as it will help reduce carbon footprint of local car journeys and provide an extension to the wildlife corridor of the existing Strawberry line.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1
"1) If enough people sign up to show interest, this will put more pressure on the council to prioritise the Strawberry line to Clevedon cycle path. Our job initially is to spread the word so as many people know thecycle path extension is being considered by the council. The main factors that could hinder the project are: The motorway crossing, objections from land owners, lack of money and lack of interest. 2) People will be able to travel between Clevedon and Yatton (and beyond) without using a road. This will reduce traffic and pollution and also improve fitness and safety. Parking could become a problem at the start points if the route became popular with people not resident in Clevedon/Yatton.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1
"A wide scale demonstration of local support across a broad demographic - Constructive negotiations with the relevant private landowners utilisation the factor of wide spread local support- Effective collaborative problem solving to overcome technical difficulties ie Motor way- A clear project plan demonstrating interdependency between different Elements- Realistic funding from existing public sector budgets / grants , private corporate funding & public funding ie crowd funding- Upgrading existing paths at Yatton & within Clevedon with clear signage that will complement and further enhance the planned extension- Agreement on a final route particularly how it accesses and flows around Clevedon to ensure it services all parts of the town .LESS LIKELY - Antagonising the relevant land owners , this could be through poor or little communication and lack of empathy for their position.- Further cuts to public sector budgets - Reduction of private sector contributions- Adoption of a chaotic approach to the project which could undermine the confidence of the community, impact on the negotiations with landowners and effect the ability to attract funding .- SLE once we have it: Safer cycling / walking / running around Clevedon & from Clevedon to Yatton and beyond , for a wide range of age groups and abilities.- A positive impact on physical health and wellbeing of the local communities .- Increased cross fertilisation between communities along the Strawberry Line.- Increased visitors to North Somerset as a cycle network is a proven attraction for tourists- A rise in business and general prosperity to Clevedon- A viable environmentally friendly alternative to using a car .- Facilitation of green commuters bike then train to Bath & bristol and beyond.- WORSE More bikes in Clevedon , so will need appropriate infrastructure to support it eg bike racks , clear cycle routes around Clevedon.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,1
