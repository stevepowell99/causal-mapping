"When I became a member of INYAS, and then the GYA, I was going through a long and very stressful phase in my career. I was constantly being discriminated against by the Director of my institute and was being refused tenure in spite of my having a better performance than most of the tenured colleagues in my department. This is because I was a woman with an ambition, who refused to bow down and beg before the authorities. Being accepted as a member of the GYA gave me immense confidence boost, as did the successful founding of INYAS. When I attended the GYA AGM and interacted with people all across the globe, I had extremely satisfying discussions that opened up new vistas of thought for me, and helped me to dream bigger. This helped to put the negativities at the institute behind me and look forward. On a different note, my experience at the GYA gave me ideas, sometimes subtle ones, that could be incorporated in the functioning of INYAS. As I got involved with the GYA, I spoke to friends and colleagues in India about it, and promoted the GYA through social media. It is now very satisfying to see the increasing interest in India about the GYA, which is also reflected in the GYA membership. Especially satisfying for me is the fact that in the last two years, two INYAS members have been selected to be members of the GYA.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"From the recent GYA working trip for the INGSA workshop in Tokyo, I have different possitive memories.  However, I would like to share a story when I received the survey from the people in charge of the funding proposal for a GloSYS Latin America. To certain point, filling the form was like a sort of usual formality. But what strikes me, -for good-, is when as a follow up message, Karen Wiemann contacted me asking for my inputs ans ideas on the current status of Latin American young scientific community. She was really eager to know the situation in my region, so I inmediatly thought that it was not ""just a burocratic"" form, so there is actual serious concern on that situation. I found it very stimulating, rewarding, and I truly appreciate this concern!. Vielen dank!...",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"This is the speech I gave at the AGM in Eindhoven, which describes some of my story (at the bottom is a link to a related blogpost as well): 

The Global Young Academy has changed my life. And I don<U+FFFD>t mean the 14,003 emails that passed through my inbox in the past two years as of this morning. Those changed my <U+FFFD>daily<U+FFFD> life. 

No I mean it: the GYA has changed my life, my life course. 

Three weeks ago I was in South-Africa to help with the second edition of the Africa Science Leadership Program. It<U+FFFD>s a program to build leadership capacity in Africa and to shape the science system. The fellows came from around the continent. Angola, Egypt, Kenia, Nigeria, Mauritius. Many of them have big plans. A meteorite scientist from Morocco wants to set up an African Space Agency. You can<U+FFFD>t say that that<U+FFFD>s not a vision. 

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas. There is still work to do there, but these are marginal improvements in comparison. So I am changing direction.  

My shift in direction is credit to the GYA. This organization does make change happen, starting on a very personal level.

Epilogue: in the past few years, an all very much related to the GYA, I have conducted several projects related to the topic of refugees and migration. With the efforts of others, this has culminated in the GYAs mentoring program for refugee scholars (and related activities), a documentary in which the GYA features, an academic symposium on integration of refugees and migrants and a forthcoming interdisciplinary edited volume ""Responsibility for Refugee and Migrant Integration"" with Jan-Christoph Heilinger and Karly Kehoe.

"GYA has opened up a lot of opportunities for me. These opportunities brought me to many places, and allowed me to experience diverse cultures and connect with varied individuals, but more importantly, gave me an opportunity to learn new things, enrich my skills, discover more of my talents, and think beyond my own research field. Being part of GYA means working in multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural, highly international projects. These enriching experiences would not be possible if I just concentrated on my own research field. This I believe is the most important influence GYA had on my own personal life and career.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9
"The GYA has impacted immensely on my personal and career development, professional network, capability to impact positively on young scientists, collaborators and my national young academy. In one respect, my professional network has greatly grown with my membership of the GYA with enhanced latitude for collaborative research and engagement. I was recently involved in putting up a proposal for the Africa Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) Project on behalf of my University. This project involves the participation of regional and international collaborators. It was not difficult getting willing and capable collaborators from Ghana, Mauritius, Senegal and Zimbabwe from my GYA connections. The good news is that the bidding was successful. On another note the GYA has over the years enhanced my skills of mentorship, science communication and diplomacy through training opportunities that have been provided over the years. This has impacted positively on my voluntary support to younger scientists, collaborators and my national young academy, especially when I served as President of the body for 2 years. GYA gatherings were always opportunities to strengthen my ideas and have insights into new ideas which were always brought back home to drive one initiative or the other in my national young academy. Through these motivations, I was able to get a grant from the US Consulate in the commercial nerve centre of my Country to organise a capacity building workshop for young-early career women scientists in my country. My national young academy, with the support of the senior academy, thereafter got an IAP grant to replicate the workshop on a larger scale for young-early career women scientists in West Africa. It turned out to be a very successful event. My involvements in working group activities, the planning and execution of the 2nd Africa Young Academies Regional Conference in Mauritius, the GloSYS Africa Project etc. have greatly sharpened by team work, leadership and collaborative engagement skills. My membership and involvements in the GYA also opened many doors of opportunities for me for personal and professional development.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10
"I only recently joined the GYA and wasnt able to attend the Annual Meeting this year. Im a committee member and get to see the amazing work that others are doing. Also, being a GYA member has certainly helped me become a member of our national academy.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11
"If I think about the greatest lasting effect of the GYA on me as a person, excluding benefits only to my career, the most significant impact the GYA has had on me is the network of friends I have built who are passionate about improving society through the work they do and the activities they volunteer on and they way they have changed my thinking.    Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12

"Becoming a member of GYA helped me in many different directions. The most important influence that GYA had on my professional and personal life was that is boosted my self-confidence, GREATLY! Just imagine, you are selected to be a member of a society of 200 top people from all around the world! Of course it does that!  But it was not just the selection that helped me with my confidence, but the people. In my first AGM I couldnt believe that how much faith everyone had in me, even I didnt trust myself back then to accept all these responsibilities as much as they did. I kept asking myself, how do they know that I can do this?!  GYA also helped greatly with my networking. Something that was not my strongest point. Its a safe, friendly and open environment that I feel I can easily approach everyone, get to know them and share my thoughts. I think this is one of the most important qualities of GYA that we should protect, and make sure that everyone feels the same; welcome, safe and worthy.   I feel more connected. I have found my way into interesting areas that were not my expertise by academic studies, but are now by practice.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14

"I am extremely grateful for the opportunities given to me by membership in GYA. I remember vividly the moment I heard first about GYA (a national foundation who gave me an award for my PhD thesis suggested me) and was immediately fascinated by the truly global and interdisciplinary group of promising young scholars. When I became a member, my expectations were more than fulfilled: I found myself among like-minded committed young scholars who did not only do great work but were also wonderful persons. I think that the ""commitment to service"" criterium in the selection process is absolutely essential.    As one of the most positive aspects of my membership, I want to point out the friendships (across continents and disciplines) that resulted from close and professionally very fruitful collaboration within a working group where we managed to get external third party funding, organised events, and realised several publications.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27
"At GYA events, I meet early career researchers from across the world and get the chance to interact with them personally. So GYA allows me to get first-hand insights into the research systems and working conditions for researchers across the globe.  For example, I met a someone from Poland and we got on well. We sat together on the day the Polish Government startet its ""reform"" of the judiciary system in Poland. To hear her reaction to it first hand and get her views on the developments in her country was really moving and helped me understand much better.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28
"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia. I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet. The reasons are not having enough experience in this kind of organisation, as well as not enough time for my career. I am still striving to earn enough monthly salary for my family.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29
"Im grateful for having had the opportunity to participate in the pre-CILAC scientific leadership training.

I didnt really know what I was getting into and Im so happy I did attend both the pre-conference training and CILAC. In simple words, these opportunities had a huge impact in my life:    (1) I met incredibly inspiring colleagues from around the world that think like me, making me feel like Im not alone which is often difficult when you are on of the few STEM PhDs in a tiny Caribbean island.  (2) To my surprise, I truly networked extensively at CILAC and made some great contacts outside of the GYA group that already have shown their worth by the offer of additional opportunities.

(4) I have made the decision to apply to a scientific diplomacy training in 2019.  (5) I will apply to GYA in Fall 2019.

I recall Bernard Slippers visiting me in Cambridge when his university was looking to design a new institute, and he was able to meet with several senior university officials here to receive advice and to have discussions, interactions that would not have been possible without our prior engagement through the GYA.     I also sit on several committees at Cambridge that look at admission and funding for undergraduate and postgraduate students. I have found that the understanding I have developed of scientific education around the world through my interactions at the GYA has been enormously helpful in this role.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38
"My involvement in the GloSYS-ASEAN study was my first experience working concretely together with social scientists. It was most insightful to learn some basics about survey design and analysis and potential pitfalls, with the take-home message that there are lots of non-trivial issues and it needs specific expertise for doing surveys properly.     In fact, this experience has been very helpful in the context of increasing demand to demonstrate ""impact"" of public engagement activities, which frequently leads to some feedback forms being used. I now understand that many of them are pretty much pointless and do not serve their goals.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39
"If I think about the greatest lasting effect of the GYA on me as a person, excluding benefits only to my career, the most significant impact the GYA has had on me is the network of friends I have built who are passionate about improving society through the work they do and the activities they volunteer on and they way they have changed my thinking.    Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40
"Im grateful for having had the opportunity to participate in the pre-CILAC scientific leadership training. Before this opportunity, I had given a little bit of thought to science diplomacy but very superficially. I didnt know organizations like TWAS, IAP and GYA existed.    I didnt really know what I was getting into and Im so happy I did attend both the pre-conference training and CILAC. In simple words, these opportunities had a huge impact in my life:    (1) I met incredibly inspiring colleagues from around the world that think like me, making me feel like Im not alone which is often difficult when you are on of the few STEM PhDs in a tiny Caribbean island.  (2) To my surprise, I truly networked extensively at CILAC and made some great contacts outside of the GYA group that already have shown their worth by the offer of additional opportunities.  (3) The pre-conference training group really bonded well and now we have a resource for group mentoring through brainstorming together.  (4) I have made the decision to apply to a scientific diplomacy training in 2019.  (5) I will apply to GYA in Fall 2019.  (6) I feel empowered to move through with my intention of starting a non-profit in the U.S. Virgin Islands that was originally planned for the characterization of data gaps in the Territory. However, now I will weave the mission to reflect SDGs that are applicable to our objectives.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41
"In a recent conference, I have personally seen how GYA is making tremendous efforts to communicate science to the civic society and contributing to spreading awareness about the UNs SDGs and also rallying for everyone to make an effort. GYA is in a perfect position, consisting of scientists from all over the world whom some Ive met to do amazing things in all sorts of fields which will certainly benefit humanity, society and the environment. Without the support of the GYA, I would not have had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the GYA and attended both the leadership workshop and conference. The leadership workshop was an eye-opening experience and was certainly instrumental in providing some bearings for me to navigate my next path in life as a scientist. I feel extremely inspired and motivated to do more and see how I can contribute to my country, science and the world as a whole.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,42
"My first AGM this year (2018) has been a stimulating event, both, personally and scientifically. GYA members who I meet between being invited to join the GYA and my first AGM told me how much they enjoyed the AGM atmosphere. However, I wondered what might it be that will make an AGM special for me. Looking back, there were three main aspects, I would like to summarized here, that made my AGM special and different from other conferences:     - The AGM provides GYA members with a longed for and needed opportunity to come and work together in person. This helps create a network and foundation for later long-distance work, but, moreover, helps to find common values and to identify shared ideas that can guide member activities throughout the year.    - The AGM combines an annual meeting (needed for organisational discussions or working group meetings) and a interdisciplinary scientific conference. Everything happens in a multidisciplinary and multicultural space. Attendees think and talk about familiar and new ideas, about how to apply familiar ideas to new areas, and explore the scope for new cooperation across disciplines, countries and cultures. There is not enough time to follow-up on all stimulating input, and impulses from the AGM last beyond the meeting.    - The AGM helps learning by living what it means that the GYA is a member driven organisation, the opportunities and challenges that come with it. It is a place that allows to experience the spirit of the GYA and to learn that it is okay to say, I do not know yet know but would learn how to be an active part of the GYA. Part of this happens because ideas for engagement just start develop as new, current and past members meet and I attended my first WG meetings.    (Question 14.-17. left open on purpose as too early to assess)",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,43
"At GYA events, I meet early career researchers from across the world and get the chance to interact with them personally. So GYA allows me to get first-hand insights into the research systems and working conditions for researchers across the globe.  For example, I met a someone from Poland and we got on well. We sat together on the day the Polish Government startet its ""reform"" of the judiciary system in Poland. To hear her reaction to it first hand and get her views on the developments in her country was really moving and helped me understand much better.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,44
"GYA co-organised the ASEAN Science Leadership Programme in Kuala Lumpur in 2017 and I was one of the participants. This event has a positive impact on me as it opened the door for me to know many researchers in the ASEAN region. I learned a lot from this event and it also allowed me to learn what other Young Academies in the region are doing. One of the projects that came out from the ASEAN Science Leadership Programme is the Responsible Conduct of Research Programme. After some planning and with the strong support of GYA members in the ASEAN region, ASEAN has established the ASEAN Young Scientists Network and the Responsible Conduct of Research Programme will be one of the key programmes of this ASEAN network.     In addition, I feel that the existence of GYA is very important because it acts as a cohesive network for all other Young Academies. It makes all the Young Academies feel that we are part of a larger global community. When I talk about my own Young Academy, which I often do, I always talk about how our Young Academy is also part of GYA and that gives our Young Academy more credibility and clout.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,45
"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia. I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet. The reasons are not having enough experience in this kind of organisation, as well as not enough time for my career. I am still striving to earn enough monthly salary for my family.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46
"The GYA has enabled me to be connected with some of the most exciting minds I have every met. I have had the privilege of attending a number of great educational institutions, and to be post-doc or employed at a number of many others. Nowhere have I met the range, depth and enthusiasm and internationalism of attendees like at one of the annual general meetings. I have made connections (I hope) for life at the GYA.        -  ANother story would be the possibility of becoming engaged hands-on in matters related to the Sustainable Development Goals. I have had the honor to participate in various IAP meetings of the SCience for Poverty Eradication Committee (Beijing, Halle) and was able to connect to scholars here working on the question of how science can best inform the implementation of the SDGs.

Just imagine, you are selected to be a member of a society of 200 top people from all around the world! Of course it does that!  But it was not just the selection that helped me with my confidence, but the people. In my first AGM I couldnt believe that how much faith everyone had in me, even I didnt trust myself back then to accept all these responsibilities as much as they did. I kept asking myself, how do they know that I can do this?!  GYA also helped greatly with my networking. Something that was not my strongest point. Its a safe, friendly and open environment that I feel I can easily approach everyone, get to know them and share my thoughts. I think this is one of the most important qualities of GYA that we should protect, and make sure that everyone feels the same; welcome, safe and worthy.   I feel more connected.

The issue at stake was, at base, about differing interpretations of democracy and its consequences for decision-making. It nearly tore the organization apart and took a year to repair some of the damage done. But repair we did, and the individuals at the center (who were both on the EC at the time) found their way past their disagreements to become dear friends.

These diverse perspectives have been eye-opening personally and has opened my mind for thinking about broader science policy and how science can serve as a diplomatic tool for building better relations and for improving our planet.

"The GYA has impacted immensely on my personal and career development, professional network, capability to impact positively on young scientists, collaborators and my national young academy. In one respect, my professional network has greatly grown with my membership of the GYA with enhanced latitude for collaborative research and engagement. I was recently involved in putting up a proposal for the Africa Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) Project on behalf of my University. This project involves the participation of regional and international collaborators. It was not difficult getting willing and capable collaborators from Ghana, Mauritius, Senegal and Zimbabwe from my GYA connections. The good news is that the bidding was successful. On another note the GYA has over the years enhanced my skills of mentorship, science communication and diplomacy through training opportunities that have been provided over the years. This has impacted positively on my voluntary support to younger scientists, collaborators and my national young academy, especially when I served as President of the body for 2 years. GYA gatherings were always opportunities to strengthen my ideas and have insights into new ideas which were always brought back home to drive one initiative or the other in my national young academy. Through these motivations, I was able to get a grant from the US Consulate in the commercial nerve centre of my Country to organise a capacity building workshop for young-early career women scientists in my country. My national young academy, with the support of the senior academy, thereafter got an IAP grant to replicate the workshop on a larger scale for young-early career women scientists in West Africa. It turned out to be a very successful event. My involvements in working group activities, the planning and execution of the 2nd Africa Young Academies Regional Conference in Mauritius, the GloSYS Africa Project etc. have greatly sharpened by team work, leadership and collaborative engagement skills. My membership and involvements in the GYA also opened many doors of opportunities for me for personal and professional development.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,79

"In the context that I am showing below (copy of an email *), I participated in a GYA meeting for the first time. For me it was very important to share with colleagues the different common scientific problems. In addition, it was very pleasant to think and share common objectives so that, in the immediate future, we can develop an inclusive, diverse and service-oriented science for the people. On my return from the CILAC forum and the Scientific Leadership training workshop prior to the conference (GYA), I gave a seminar with my work group and my students. Now we are working on concrete activities to include different topics tackled in CILAC and in GYA in our progarams of studies and our research activities. I think GYA is an excellent way to think, to discuss generating concrete actions that improve scientific activity. Therefore I will be happy to share experiences as a member of GYA.

Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,86

Before this opportunity, I had given a little bit of thought to science diplomacy but very superficially. I didnt know organizations like TWAS, IAP and GYA existed.    I didnt really know what I was getting into and Im so happy I did attend both the pre-conference training and CILAC. In simple words, these opportunities had a huge impact in my life:    (1) I met incredibly inspiring colleagues from around the world that think like me, making me feel like Im not alone which is often difficult when you are on of the few STEM PhDs in a tiny Caribbean island.  (2) To my surprise, I truly networked extensively at CILAC and made some great contacts outside of the GYA group that already have shown their worth by the offer of additional opportunities.  (3) The pre-conference training group really bonded well and now we have a resource for group mentoring through brainstorming together.  (4) I have made the decision to apply to a scientific diplomacy training in 2019.  (5) I will apply to GYA in Fall 2019.

But it was not just the selection that helped me with my confidence, but the people. In my first AGM I couldnt believe that how much faith everyone had in me, even I didnt trust myself back then to accept all these responsibilities as much as they did. I kept asking myself, how do they know that I can do this?!  GYA also helped greatly with my networking. Something that was not my strongest point. Its a safe, friendly and open environment that I feel I can easily approach everyone, get to know them and share my thoughts. I think this is one of the most important qualities of GYA that we should protect, and make sure that everyone feels the same; welcome, safe and worthy.   I feel more connected.

"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia.

Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet.

It nearly tore the organization apart and took a year to repair some of the damage done. But repair we did, and the individuals at the center (who were both on the EC at the time) found their way past their disagreements to become dear friends.

"Be part of the GYA is one of the most important opportunities that I had and one of which that I am particularly proud. It has represented an open mining processes from an academic but more important human perspective.

"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia. I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet. The reasons are not having enough experience in this kind of organisation, as well as not enough time for my career. I am still striving to earn enough monthly salary for my family.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,123
"The process of establishing and supporting and being part of the Science Leadership Programs has been hugely influential for me. It has led to new friendships across borders, to deep learning about how we can collaborate, to insight in the process of creative problem solving and to new experiences as a facilitator. It has been fantastic to meet so many of our SLP fellows and get to know them over the course of an intensive week, and keep in touch with them over time. It has been inspirational to work with people like Bernard Slippers, who has a big vision for improving the state of science and its contribution to society in Africa. And it has been wonderful to learn from the facilitators of KnowInnovation-Inclusive Innovation, who have been so committed to partnering with us in developing a program with a strong ripple effect. Im very curious where it will lead us next.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,124
"The GYA has profoundly affected how I think about cultural diversity. I even wrote a blog about it that was republished in one of the early issues of Connections.  Though I confess I didnt tell the really meat of the story, which involved an incident during the General Assembly that divided the organization roughly along so-called developed vs developing  country lines (and I acknowledge the loaded nature of those terms).  The issue at stake was, at base, about differing interpretations of democracy and its consequences for decision-making. It nearly tore the organization apart and took a year to repair some of the damage done. But repair we did, and the individuals at the center (who were both on the EC at the time) found their way past their disagreements to become dear friends.  This incident, and the year of repair afterwards, taught me more about communication and leadership, I suspect, than any course or training. The GYA was important because it is hard to imagine this happening anywhere else, especially at an early career stage.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,125
"Im grateful for having had the opportunity to participate in the pre-CILAC scientific leadership training. Before this opportunity, I had given a little bit of thought to science diplomacy but very superficially. I didnt know organizations like TWAS, IAP and GYA existed.    I didnt really know what I was getting into and Im so happy I did attend both the pre-conference training and CILAC. In simple words, these opportunities had a huge impact in my life:    (1) I met incredibly inspiring colleagues from around the world that think like me, making me feel like Im not alone which is often difficult when you are on of the few STEM PhDs in a tiny Caribbean island.  (2) To my surprise, I truly networked extensively at CILAC and made some great contacts outside of the GYA group that already have shown their worth by the offer of additional opportunities.  (3) The pre-conference training group really bonded well and now we have a resource for group mentoring through brainstorming together.  (4) I have made the decision to apply to a scientific diplomacy training in 2019.  (5) I will apply to GYA in Fall 2019.  (6) I feel empowered to move through with my intention of starting a non-profit in the U.S. Virgin Islands that was originally planned for the characterization of data gaps in the Territory. However, now I will weave the mission to reflect SDGs that are applicable to our objectives.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,126
"In a recent conference, I have personally seen how GYA is making tremendous efforts to communicate science to the civic society and contributing to spreading awareness about the UNs SDGs and also rallying for everyone to make an effort. GYA is in a perfect position, consisting of scientists from all over the world whom some Ive met to do amazing things in all sorts of fields which will certainly benefit humanity, society and the environment. Without the support of the GYA, I would not have had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the GYA and attended both the leadership workshop and conference. The leadership workshop was an eye-opening experience and was certainly instrumental in providing some bearings for me to navigate my next path in life as a scientist. I feel extremely inspired and motivated to do more and see how I can contribute to my country, science and the world as a whole.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,127

"When I became a member of INYAS, and then the GYA, I was going through a long and very stressful phase in my career. I was constantly being discriminated against by the Director of my institute and was being refused tenure in spite of my having a better performance than most of the tenured colleagues in my department. This is because I was a woman with an ambition, who refused to bow down and beg before the authorities. Being accepted as a member of the GYA gave me immense confidence boost, as did the successful founding of INYAS. When I attended the GYA AGM and interacted with people all across the globe, I had extremely satisfying discussions that opened up new vistas of thought for me, and helped me to dream bigger. This helped to put the negativities at the institute behind me and look forward. On a different note, my experience at the GYA gave me ideas, sometimes subtle ones, that could be incorporated in the functioning of INYAS. As I got involved with the GYA, I spoke to friends and colleagues in India about it, and promoted the GYA through social media. It is now very satisfying to see the increasing interest in India about the GYA, which is also reflected in the GYA membership. Especially satisfying for me is the fact that in the last two years, two INYAS members have been selected to be members of the GYA.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,129
"This is the speech I gave at the AGM in Eindhoven, which describes some of my story (at the bottom is a link to a related blogpost as well): 

The Global Young Academy has changed my life. And I don<U+FFFD>t mean the 14,003 emails that passed through my inbox in the past two years as of this morning. Those changed my <U+FFFD>daily<U+FFFD> life. 

No I mean it: the GYA has changed my life, my life course. 

Three weeks ago I was in South-Africa to help with the second edition of the Africa Science Leadership Program. It<U+FFFD>s a program to build leadership capacity in Africa and to shape the science system. The fellows came from around the continent. Angola, Egypt, Kenia, Nigeria, Mauritius. Many of them have big plans. A meteorite scientist from Morocco wants to set up an African Space Agency. You can<U+FFFD>t say that that<U+FFFD>s not a vision. 

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas. There is still work to do there, but these are marginal improvements in comparison. So I am changing direction.  

My shift in direction is credit to the GYA. This organization does make change happen, starting on a very personal level.

Epilogue: in the past few years, an all very much related to the GYA, I have conducted several projects related to the topic of refugees and migration. With the efforts of others, this has culminated in the GYAs mentoring program for refugee scholars (and related activities), a documentary in which the GYA features, an academic symposium on integration of refugees and migrants and a forthcoming interdisciplinary edited volume ""Responsibility for Refugee and Migrant Integration"" with Jan-Christoph Heilinger and Karly Kehoe. In all these activities, scholars with a refugee background have been actively involved and vocal about what they find important.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,130
"GYA has opened up a lot of opportunities for me. These opportunities brought me to many places, and allowed me to experience diverse cultures and connect with varied individuals, but more importantly, gave me an opportunity to learn new things, enrich my skills, discover more of my talents, and think beyond my own research field. Being part of GYA means working in multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural, highly international projects. These enriching experiences would not be possible if I just concentrated on my own research field. This I believe is the most important influence GYA had on my own personal life and career.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,131
"The GYA has been very helpful in my work as Chair of a National Young Academy. I have been in constant touch with various members of the GYA who have been an important resource in helping me to build the organizational capacity as well as increase societal impact of my Young Academy. GYA members have been a source a great ideas and guidance so far. They have also helped to connect me, personally, to important opportunities for scientific and leadership development.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,132
"The GYA has impacted immensely on my personal and career development, professional network, capability to impact positively on young scientists, collaborators and my national young academy. In one respect, my professional network has greatly grown with my membership of the GYA with enhanced latitude for collaborative research and engagement. I was recently involved in putting up a proposal for the Africa Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) Project on behalf of my University. This project involves the participation of regional and international collaborators. It was not difficult getting willing and capable collaborators from Ghana, Mauritius, Senegal and Zimbabwe from my GYA connections. The good news is that the bidding was successful. On another note the GYA has over the years enhanced my skills of mentorship, science communication and diplomacy through training opportunities that have been provided over the years. This has impacted positively on my voluntary support to younger scientists, collaborators and my national young academy, especially when I served as President of the body for 2 years. GYA gatherings were always opportunities to strengthen my ideas and have insights into new ideas which were always brought back home to drive one initiative or the other in my national young academy. Through these motivations, I was able to get a grant from the US Consulate in the commercial nerve centre of my Country to organise a capacity building workshop for young-early career women scientists in my country. My national young academy, with the support of the senior academy, thereafter got an IAP grant to replicate the workshop on a larger scale for young-early career women scientists in West Africa. It turned out to be a very successful event. My involvements in working group activities, the planning and execution of the 2nd Africa Young Academies Regional Conference in Mauritius, the GloSYS Africa Project etc. have greatly sharpened by team work, leadership and collaborative engagement skills. My membership and involvements in the GYA also opened many doors of opportunities for me for personal and professional development.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,133

"For me it was amazing to meet all of young leaders from different fields, from different places of the world. I was always attending specialized meeteings and conferences, but this was something totally different. It is really great, to have all people with different experience and background, but with something very important and common: they are active part of the world, they are really willing to make changes in this world. For me this is the most important part of GYA-    Another important part is Workgroup Bio2Bio, which started at GYA, but I believe it will be very important worldwide, with national institutions of many countries and international institutions to be actively involved.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,135
1) The heartful support of some GYA colleagues in difficult and challenging moments.    2) The bond that connects the totally different disciplines and fields of knowledge of some GYA colleagues and makes them converge in newly created initiatives launched for the benefit of global positive societal impact (we hope!).,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,136

GYA members who I meet between being invited to join the GYA and my first AGM told me how much they enjoyed the AGM atmosphere. However, I wondered what might it be that will make an AGM special for me. Looking back, there were three main aspects, I would like to summarized here, that made my AGM special and different from other conferences:     - The AGM provides GYA members with a longed for and needed opportunity to come and work together in person. This helps create a network and foundation for later long-distance work, but, moreover, helps to find common values and to identify shared ideas that can guide member activities throughout the year.    - The AGM combines an annual meeting (needed for organisational discussions or working group meetings) and a interdisciplinary scientific conference. Everything happens in a multidisciplinary and multicultural space. Attendees think and talk about familiar and new ideas, about how to apply familiar ideas to new areas, and explore the scope for new cooperation across disciplines, countries and cultures. There is not enough time to follow-up on all stimulating input, and impulses from the AGM last beyond the meeting.    - The AGM helps learning by living what it means that the GYA is a member driven organisation, the opportunities and challenges that come with it. It is a place that allows to experience the spirit of the GYA and to learn that it is okay to say, I do not know yet know but would learn how to be an active part of the GYA. Part of this happens because ideas for engagement just start develop as new, current and past members meet and I attended my first WG meetings.

This helps create a network and foundation for later long-distance work, but, moreover, helps to find common values and to identify shared ideas that can guide member activities throughout the year.    - The AGM combines an annual meeting (needed for organisational discussions or working group meetings) and a interdisciplinary scientific conference. Everything happens in a multidisciplinary and multicultural space. Attendees think and talk about familiar and new ideas, about how to apply familiar ideas to new areas, and explore the scope for new cooperation across disciplines, countries and cultures. There is not enough time to follow-up on all stimulating input, and impulses from the AGM last beyond the meeting.    - The AGM helps learning by living what it means that the GYA is a member driven organisation, the opportunities and challenges that come with it. It is a place that allows to experience the spirit of the GYA and to learn that it is okay to say, I do not know yet know but would learn how to be an active part of the GYA. Part of this happens because ideas for engagement just start develop as new, current and past members meet and I attended my first WG meetings.

"It was really encouraging seeing so many young scientists united for a global purpose, coordinating their joint voices to use science advice for policy; to see hundreds of young people enthusiastically donating their time working because they recognize how important science is to society, and how crucial it is to include it in policymaking universally. I found myself reflecting, it is so empowering seeing all this energy put to work for noble objectives",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,147
"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia. I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet.

"Im grateful for having had the opportunity to participate in the pre-CILAC scientific leadership training. Before this opportunity, I had given a little bit of thought to science diplomacy but very superficially. I didnt know organizations like TWAS, IAP and GYA existed.    I didnt really know what I was getting into and Im so happy I did attend both the pre-conference training and CILAC. In simple words, these opportunities had a huge impact in my life:    (1) I met incredibly inspiring colleagues from around the world that think like me, making me feel like Im not alone which is often difficult when you are on of the few STEM PhDs in a tiny Caribbean island.  (2) To my surprise, I truly networked extensively at CILAC and made some great contacts outside of the GYA group that already have shown their worth by the offer of additional opportunities.  (3) The pre-conference training group really bonded well and now we have a resource for group mentoring through brainstorming together.  (4) I have made the decision to apply to a scientific diplomacy training in 2019.  (5) I will apply to GYA in Fall 2019.

"If I think about the greatest lasting effect of the GYA on me as a person, excluding benefits only to my career, the most significant impact the GYA has had on me is the network of friends I have built who are passionate about improving society through the work they do and the activities they volunteer on and they way they have changed my thinking.    Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,160

"When I became a member of INYAS, and then the GYA, I was going through a long and very stressful phase in my career. I was constantly being discriminated against by the Director of my institute and was being refused tenure in spite of my having a better performance than most of the tenured colleagues in my department. This is because I was a woman with an ambition, who refused to bow down and beg before the authorities. Being accepted as a member of the GYA gave me immense confidence boost, as did the successful founding of INYAS. When I attended the GYA AGM and interacted with people all across the globe, I had extremely satisfying discussions that opened up new vistas of thought for me, and helped me to dream bigger. This helped to put the negativities at the institute behind me and look forward. On a different note, my experience at the GYA gave me ideas, sometimes subtle ones, that could be incorporated in the functioning of INYAS. As I got involved with the GYA, I spoke to friends and colleagues in India about it, and promoted the GYA through social media. It is now very satisfying to see the increasing interest in India about the GYA, which is also reflected in the GYA membership. Especially satisfying for me is the fact that in the last two years, two INYAS members have been selected to be members of the GYA.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,181
"This is the speech I gave at the AGM in Eindhoven, which describes some of my story (at the bottom is a link to a related blogpost as well): 

The Global Young Academy has changed my life. And I don<U+FFFD>t mean the 14,003 emails that passed through my inbox in the past two years as of this morning. Those changed my <U+FFFD>daily<U+FFFD> life. 

No I mean it: the GYA has changed my life, my life course. 

Three weeks ago I was in South-Africa to help with the second edition of the Africa Science Leadership Program. It<U+FFFD>s a program to build leadership capacity in Africa and to shape the science system. The fellows came from around the continent. Angola, Egypt, Kenia, Nigeria, Mauritius. Many of them have big plans. A meteorite scientist from Morocco wants to set up an African Space Agency. You can<U+FFFD>t say that that<U+FFFD>s not a vision. 

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas. There is still work to do there, but these are marginal improvements in comparison. So I am changing direction.  

My shift in direction is credit to the GYA. This organization does make change happen, starting on a very personal level.

"If I think about the greatest lasting effect of the GYA on me as a person, excluding benefits only to my career, the most significant impact the GYA has had on me is the network of friends I have built who are passionate about improving society through the work they do and the activities they volunteer on and they way they have changed my thinking.    Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective.

"My first AGM this year (2018) has been a stimulating event, both, personally and scientifically. GYA members who I meet between being invited to join the GYA and my first AGM told me how much they enjoyed the AGM atmosphere. However, I wondered what might it be that will make an AGM special for me. Looking back, there were three main aspects, I would like to summarized here, that made my AGM special and different from other conferences:     - The AGM provides GYA members with a longed for and needed opportunity to come and work together in person. This helps create a network and foundation for later long-distance work, but, moreover, helps to find common values and to identify shared ideas that can guide member activities throughout the year.    - The AGM combines an annual meeting (needed for organisational discussions or working group meetings) and a interdisciplinary scientific conference. Everything happens in a multidisciplinary and multicultural space. Attendees think and talk about familiar and new ideas, about how to apply familiar ideas to new areas, and explore the scope for new cooperation across disciplines, countries and cultures. There is not enough time to follow-up on all stimulating input, and impulses from the AGM last beyond the meeting.    - The AGM helps learning by living what it means that the GYA is a member driven organisation, the opportunities and challenges that come with it. It is a place that allows to experience the spirit of the GYA and to learn that it is okay to say, I do not know yet know but would learn how to be an active part of the GYA. Part of this happens because ideas for engagement just start develop as new, current and past members meet and I attended my first WG meetings.    (Question 14.-17. left open on purpose as too early to assess)",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,193
"At GYA events, I meet early career researchers from across the world and get the chance to interact with them personally. So GYA allows me to get first-hand insights into the research systems and working conditions for researchers across the globe.  For example, I met a someone from Poland and we got on well. We sat together on the day the Polish Government startet its ""reform"" of the judiciary system in Poland. To hear her reaction to it first hand and get her views on the developments in her country was really moving and helped me understand much better.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,194
"Im happy to participate in Scholars at Risk initiative and have intense and productive communication with a scholar from Yemen.   I also feel having a strong backup, if needed by scholars from similarly thinking all over the world.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,195
"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia. I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet. The reasons are not having enough experience in this kind of organisation, as well as not enough time for my career. I am still striving to earn enough monthly salary for my family.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,196
"The most positive influence of GYA to me has been meeting the incredible members from diverse backgrounds, cultures, societies, and training. These diverse perspectives have been eye-opening personally and has opened my mind for thinking about broader science policy and how science can serve as a diplomatic tool for building better relations and for improving our planet. Prior to my involvement in GYA, I did not think about these issues much and it is thanks to the members and the organization, that my mind has become opened to new ways of thinking about science and the influence of science on international relations.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,197
"As a white European scholar, the topic of ""trust in science"" meant certain things to me that I thought I understood more or less: skepticism of the ""elite"", the problem of money in academia etc. But when I discussed it with GYA members from other countries, I realized that it is much broader and more multi-faceted. I can mean lack of trust because of a perception that academics plagiarize each others work. It can mean lack of trustworthiness on the part of (young) scientists because of a lack of mentorship that would support them in their endeavors. And it can mean distrust in Western (!) science if those who preach it dont follow their own principles (e.g. not taking local medical treatment, which they offer to the local population, but being flown away when they catch a disease themselves). In my efforts to build the ""Trust in (Young) Scientists"" working group, this broader perspective has been extremely important for me. It will also inform my own research on this topic from a philosophical perspective.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,198
"The GYA has enabled me to be connected with some of the most exciting minds I have every met. I have had the privilege of attending a number of great educational institutions, and to be post-doc or employed at a number of many others. Nowhere have I met the range, depth and enthusiasm and internationalism of attendees like at one of the annual general meetings. I have made connections (I hope) for life at the GYA.        -  ANother story would be the possibility of becoming engaged hands-on in matters related to the Sustainable Development Goals. I have had the honor to participate in various IAP meetings of the SCience for Poverty Eradication Committee (Beijing, Halle) and was able to connect to scholars here working on the question of how science can best inform the implementation of the SDGs. I hope that I was able to make several suggestions in all these fora that could strengthen SDG implementation and improve the networking of science academies working towards SDG implementation (as some of my research is on SDG governance, this was extra helpful). ---> please help edit this story if you like to use it, we can fine.-tune or tailor it",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,199
"Since I became member of the GYA, I got respected in my institution and by colleagues.

I meet colleagues from others countries so I learned how they are organized in their National Young Academy (NYA). When I went back I decided to create a NYA. So I contacted the secretary of the Senior Academy of Science whom is ready to help me and he is helping me to set NYA in my country. As member of the GYA, I got accepted to participate in a workshop in Beijing (China). Here, I met the executive director of the Integrated Research for Disaster Risk (IRDR) who is ready to help me set a create a research center on disaster management.

"When I became a member of INYAS, and then the GYA, I was going through a long and very stressful phase in my career. I was constantly being discriminated against by the Director of my institute and was being refused tenure in spite of my having a better performance than most of the tenured colleagues in my department. This is because I was a woman with an ambition, who refused to bow down and beg before the authorities. Being accepted as a member of the GYA gave me immense confidence boost, as did the successful founding of INYAS. When I attended the GYA AGM and interacted with people all across the globe, I had extremely satisfying discussions that opened up new vistas of thought for me, and helped me to dream bigger. This helped to put the negativities at the institute behind me and look forward. On a different note, my experience at the GYA gave me ideas, sometimes subtle ones, that could be incorporated in the functioning of INYAS. As I got involved with the GYA, I spoke to friends and colleagues in India about it, and promoted the GYA through social media. It is now very satisfying to see the increasing interest in India about the GYA, which is also reflected in the GYA membership. Especially satisfying for me is the fact that in the last two years, two INYAS members have been selected to be members of the GYA.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,208

Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!!

To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.

The most positive aspect of the GYA for me is the interaction with scholars from across disciplines working on important global questions.

I always felt like a bit of an oddball scientist because I do not conform to the ""traditional"" scientist model. I dont like to be on the lab all the time and I enjoy mingling in interdisciplinary circles. As I said before, the GYA introduced me to a vast network of scientists like me. This has allowed me to make new friends, expand my network and hone my ""soft skills"". Most importantly it has inspired me to pursue the establishment of a National Young Academy at home and to keep pushing for a further enhance the role of science in the public discourse and public policy.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,218
"My first AGM this year (2018) has been a stimulating event, both, personally and scientifically. GYA members who I meet between being invited to join the GYA and my first AGM told me how much they enjoyed the AGM atmosphere. However, I wondered what might it be that will make an AGM special for me. Looking back, there were three main aspects, I would like to summarized here, that made my AGM special and different from other conferences:     - The AGM provides GYA members with a longed for and needed opportunity to come and work together in person. This helps create a network and foundation for later long-distance work, but, moreover, helps to find common values and to identify shared ideas that can guide member activities throughout the year.    - The AGM combines an annual meeting (needed for organisational discussions or working group meetings) and a interdisciplinary scientific conference. Everything happens in a multidisciplinary and multicultural space. Attendees think and talk about familiar and new ideas, about how to apply familiar ideas to new areas, and explore the scope for new cooperation across disciplines, countries and cultures. There is not enough time to follow-up on all stimulating input, and impulses from the AGM last beyond the meeting.    - The AGM helps learning by living what it means that the GYA is a member driven organisation, the opportunities and challenges that come with it. It is a place that allows to experience the spirit of the GYA and to learn that it is okay to say, I do not know yet know but would learn how to be an active part of the GYA. Part of this happens because ideas for engagement just start develop as new, current and past members meet and I attended my first WG meetings.

"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia. I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet. The reasons are not having enough experience in this kind of organisation, as well as not enough time for my career. I am still striving to earn enough monthly salary for my family.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,222
"The most positive influence of GYA to me has been meeting the incredible members from diverse backgrounds, cultures, societies, and training. These diverse perspectives have been eye-opening personally and has opened my mind for thinking about broader science policy and how science can serve as a diplomatic tool for building better relations and for improving our planet. Prior to my involvement in GYA, I did not think about these issues much and it is thanks to the members and the organization, that my mind has become opened to new ways of thinking about science and the influence of science on international relations.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,223

"This is the speech I gave at the AGM in Eindhoven, which describes some of my story (at the bottom is a link to a related blogpost as well): 

The Global Young Academy has changed my life. And I don<U+FFFD>t mean the 14,003 emails that passed through my inbox in the past two years as of this morning. Those changed my <U+FFFD>daily<U+FFFD> life. 

No I mean it: the GYA has changed my life, my life course. 

Three weeks ago I was in South-Africa to help with the second edition of the Africa Science Leadership Program. It<U+FFFD>s a program to build leadership capacity in Africa and to shape the science system. The fellows came from around the continent. Angola, Egypt, Kenia, Nigeria, Mauritius. Many of them have big plans. A meteorite scientist from Morocco wants to set up an African Space Agency. You can<U+FFFD>t say that that<U+FFFD>s not a vision. 

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas. There is still work to do there, but these are marginal improvements in comparison. So I am changing direction.  

My shift in direction is credit to the GYA. This organization does make change happen, starting on a very personal level.

"The GYA has impacted immensely on my personal and career development, professional network, capability to impact positively on young scientists, collaborators and my national young academy. In one respect, my professional network has greatly grown with my membership of the GYA with enhanced latitude for collaborative research and engagement. I was recently involved in putting up a proposal for the Africa Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) Project on behalf of my University. This project involves the participation of regional and international collaborators. It was not difficult getting willing and capable collaborators from Ghana, Mauritius, Senegal and Zimbabwe from my GYA connections. The good news is that the bidding was successful. On another note the GYA has over the years enhanced my skills of mentorship, science communication and diplomacy through training opportunities that have been provided over the years. This has impacted positively on my voluntary support to younger scientists, collaborators and my national young academy, especially when I served as President of the body for 2 years. GYA gatherings were always opportunities to strengthen my ideas and have insights into new ideas which were always brought back home to drive one initiative or the other in my national young academy. Through these motivations, I was able to get a grant from the US Consulate in the commercial nerve centre of my Country to organise a capacity building workshop for young-early career women scientists in my country. My national young academy, with the support of the senior academy, thereafter got an IAP grant to replicate the workshop on a larger scale for young-early career women scientists in West Africa. It turned out to be a very successful event. My involvements in working group activities, the planning and execution of the 2nd Africa Young Academies Regional Conference in Mauritius, the GloSYS Africa Project etc. have greatly sharpened by team work, leadership and collaborative engagement skills.

"It was really encouraging seeing so many young scientists united for a global purpose, coordinating their joint voices to use science advice for policy; to see hundreds of young people enthusiastically donating their time working because they recognize how important science is to society, and how crucial it is to include it in policymaking universally.

"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia.

"The most positive influence of GYA to me has been meeting the incredible members from diverse backgrounds, cultures, societies, and training. These diverse perspectives have been eye-opening personally and has opened my mind for thinking about broader science policy and how science can serve as a diplomatic tool for building better relations and for improving our planet. Prior to my involvement in GYA, I did not think about these issues much and it is thanks to the members and the organization, that my mind has become opened to new ways of thinking about science and the influence of science on international relations.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,245
"Since I became member of the GYA, I got respected in my institution and by colleagues.

I meet colleagues from others countries so I learned how they are organized in their National Young Academy (NYA). When I went back I decided to create a NYA. So I contacted the secretary of the Senior Academy of Science whom is ready to help me and he is helping me to set NYA in my country. As member of the GYA, I got accepted to participate in a workshop in Beijing (China). Here, I met the executive director of the Integrated Research for Disaster Risk (IRDR) who is ready to help me set a create a research center on disaster management.  All those things are happening due to GYA.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,246
"I think that the GYA itself is a most powerful science diplomacy effort. In 2012, the socialisation of GYA members clustered with regard to different regions of the world. During the final dinner, there was a table with African participants, one with East Asian and South East Asian participants, one with Europeans and North Americans, and only one with a rather mixed group (which I was sitting at). In contrast, in 2016, it was all mixed.     I much enjoyed learning more about a large number of countries to which I did not have any connection before. Moreover, it is instructive to see how people in places that are geographically far separated are affected by similar issues, and how this works out with the specific local context.     In my opinion, this experience has proven the notion that there are issues for developing countries and other issues for developed countries plainly wrong, and the GYA should not promote such a distinction.    Having been involved in capacity building in the Middle East before, I am now also a member of the Advisory Board of the Vietnam Young Academy, and am looking forward to attend the Science Forum South Africa in order to learn more about and from Africa.    My experience of learning from other GYA members from across the world has also created a drive to combat negative prejudice about various regions of the world.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,247
"The GYA has brought me many friendships that are also very diverse. My respect for young scholars from different backgrounds, including LMIC, has increased significantly. Getting to know them and listening to their stories is humbling and inspiring.    These friendships have also led to trust, and beautiful collaborations, even if sometimes the trust is shaken when friends cannot live up to their commitments - but we also learn to forgive as we understand the difficulties and pressures our friends are facing.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,248
The GYA has sparked the need for and the creation of young academies throughout the word. This movement is probably the most important result of the creation of the GYA. It has led to the realisation that early career has to be nurtured.,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,249
"In the context that I am showing below (copy of an email *), I participated in a GYA meeting for the first time. For me it was very important to share with colleagues the different common scientific problems. In addition, it was very pleasant to think and share common objectives so that, in the immediate future, we can develop an inclusive, diverse and service-oriented science for the people. On my return from the CILAC forum and the Scientific Leadership training workshop prior to the conference (GYA), I gave a seminar with my work group and my students. Now we are working on concrete activities to include different topics tackled in CILAC and in GYA in our progarams of studies and our research activities. I think GYA is an excellent way to think, to discuss generating concrete actions that improve scientific activity. Therefore I will be happy to share experiences as a member of GYA.

The most positive aspect of the GYA for me is the interaction with scholars from across disciplines working on important global questions.  I constantly rethink my own scientific interventions in light of these rich interactions and consider how my work (which tends to be quite local in nature) can expand and grow to more fully engage on a global level.,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,251
"Becoming a member of GYA helped me in many different directions. The most important influence that GYA had on my professional and personal life was that is boosted my self-confidence, GREATLY! Just imagine, you are selected to be a member of a society of 200 top people from all around the world! Of course it does that!  But it was not just the selection that helped me with my confidence, but the people. In my first AGM I couldnt believe that how much faith everyone had in me, even I didnt trust myself back then to accept all these responsibilities as much as they did. I kept asking myself, how do they know that I can do this?!  GYA also helped greatly with my networking. Something that was not my strongest point. Its a safe, friendly and open environment that I feel I can easily approach everyone, get to know them and share my thoughts. I think this is one of the most important qualities of GYA that we should protect, and make sure that everyone feels the same; welcome, safe and worthy.   I feel more connected. I have found my way into interesting areas that were not my expertise by academic studies, but are now by practice.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,252

In the GYA, I have been also involved in the SDGs work. Firstly, I represented the GYA Latin-American members in a Regional IAP-IANAS workshop held in Mexico that was addressing the implementation challenges of SDGs in my region.

"My first AGM this year (2018) has been a stimulating event, both, personally and scientifically. GYA members who I meet between being invited to join the GYA and my first AGM told me how much they enjoyed the AGM atmosphere. However, I wondered what might it be that will make an AGM special for me. Looking back, there were three main aspects, I would like to summarized here, that made my AGM special and different from other conferences:     - The AGM provides GYA members with a longed for and needed opportunity to come and work together in person. This helps create a network and foundation for later long-distance work, but, moreover, helps to find common values and to identify shared ideas that can guide member activities throughout the year.    - The AGM combines an annual meeting (needed for organisational discussions or working group meetings) and a interdisciplinary scientific conference. Everything happens in a multidisciplinary and multicultural space. Attendees think and talk about familiar and new ideas, about how to apply familiar ideas to new areas, and explore the scope for new cooperation across disciplines, countries and cultures. There is not enough time to follow-up on all stimulating input, and impulses from the AGM last beyond the meeting.    - The AGM helps learning by living what it means that the GYA is a member driven organisation, the opportunities and challenges that come with it. It is a place that allows to experience the spirit of the GYA and to learn that it is okay to say, I do not know yet know but would learn how to be an active part of the GYA. Part of this happens because ideas for engagement just start develop as new, current and past members meet and I attended my first WG meetings.

"My involvement in the GloSYS-ASEAN study was my first experience working concretely together with social scientists. It was most insightful to learn some basics about survey design and analysis and potential pitfalls, with the take-home message that there are lots of non-trivial issues and it needs specific expertise for doing surveys properly.     In fact, this experience has been very helpful in the context of increasing demand to demonstrate ""impact"" of public engagement activities, which frequently leads to some feedback forms being used. I now understand that many of them are pretty much pointless and do not serve their goals.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,259
"If I think about the greatest lasting effect of the GYA on me as a person, excluding benefits only to my career, the most significant impact the GYA has had on me is the network of friends I have built who are passionate about improving society through the work they do and the activities they volunteer on and they way they have changed my thinking.    Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,260

"When I became a member of INYAS, and then the GYA, I was going through a long and very stressful phase in my career. I was constantly being discriminated against by the Director of my institute and was being refused tenure in spite of my having a better performance than most of the tenured colleagues in my department. This is because I was a woman with an ambition, who refused to bow down and beg before the authorities. Being accepted as a member of the GYA gave me immense confidence boost, as did the successful founding of INYAS. When I attended the GYA AGM and interacted with people all across the globe, I had extremely satisfying discussions that opened up new vistas of thought for me, and helped me to dream bigger. This helped to put the negativities at the institute behind me and look forward. On a different note, my experience at the GYA gave me ideas, sometimes subtle ones, that could be incorporated in the functioning of INYAS. As I got involved with the GYA, I spoke to friends and colleagues in India about it, and promoted the GYA through social media. It is now very satisfying to see the increasing interest in India about the GYA, which is also reflected in the GYA membership. Especially satisfying for me is the fact that in the last two years, two INYAS members have been selected to be members of the GYA.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,274

"The GYA has impacted immensely on my personal and career development, professional network, capability to impact positively on young scientists, collaborators and my national young academy.

I was recently involved in putting up a proposal for the Africa Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) Project on behalf of my University. This project involves the participation of regional and international collaborators. It was not difficult getting willing and capable collaborators from Ghana, Mauritius, Senegal and Zimbabwe from my GYA connections. The good news is that the bidding was successful. On another note the GYA has over the years enhanced my skills of mentorship, science communication and diplomacy through training opportunities that have been provided over the years. This has impacted positively on my voluntary support to younger scientists, collaborators and my national young academy, especially when I served as President of the body for 2 years. GYA gatherings were always opportunities to strengthen my ideas and have insights into new ideas which were always brought back home to drive one initiative or the other in my national young academy. Through these motivations, I was able to get a grant from the US Consulate in the commercial nerve centre of my Country to organise a capacity building workshop for young-early career women scientists in my country.

I dont like to be on the lab all the time and I enjoy mingling in interdisciplinary circles. As I said before, the GYA introduced me to a vast network of scientists like me.

Ive used these skills in my own group, my institute, for GYA events at the AGM and within my work group. These have truly changed how I problem solve.     The second is negotiation skills developed though watching the interaction of member from different countries. The greatest example of have of this is being in Morocco with my work group and after a way of work we headed to the markets. One of members, who spoke arabic, although not their first language, did the bargaining for us.  There was always a lot of conversation and laughing before any negotiation on price occurred. To get the best price, they first developed a relationship with the store holder, found out about their family, and then used me and the fact that if they didnt give me they price I wanted then my friend would have to pay the difference. Thus, they leveraged the store owners humanity, not to adversely impact them, whilst they were trying to help me. And they did this by first developing a connecting with the owner.  It is a simple display of humanity and relationships and how to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. And I think of it every time I Iook at the rug in my lounge!",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,281

"The GYA has profoundly affected how I think about cultural diversity. I even wrote a blog about it that was republished in one of the early issues of Connections.  Though I confess I didnt tell the really meat of the story, which involved an incident during the General Assembly that divided the organization roughly along so-called developed vs developing  country lines (and I acknowledge the loaded nature of those terms).  The issue at stake was, at base, about differing interpretations of democracy and its consequences for decision-making. It nearly tore the organization apart and took a year to repair some of the damage done. But repair we did, and the individuals at the center (who were both on the EC at the time) found their way past their disagreements to become dear friends.  This incident, and the year of repair afterwards, taught me more about communication and leadership, I suspect, than any course or training. The GYA was important because it is hard to imagine this happening anywhere else, especially at an early career stage.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,284

"One of the main outcomes from my involvement in the GYA was broadening my horizons as a scientist. It was incredibly motivating to meet scientists from developing countries, to understand the challenges they face, and to understand how science can be a unifying framework for change. I maintain many friendships from my time with the GYA and these have also been useful professionally. I recall Bernard Slippers visiting me in Cambridge when his university was looking to design a new institute, and he was able to meet with several senior university officials here to receive advice and to have discussions, interactions that would not have been possible without our prior engagement through the GYA.     I also sit on several committees at Cambridge that look at admission and funding for undergraduate and postgraduate students. I have found that the understanding I have developed of scientific education around the world through my interactions at the GYA has been enormously helpful in this role.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,295
"Frankly speaking, the most influential thing of GYA to me is the financial support (co-funding) to the AGM. My initial intentions to apply for GYA are 1) to get the glamour of being a GYA member  2) Good for CV   3) Able to go overseas to meet people (because it is hard to get a high percentage of sponsorship from the university)   4) possible research collaboration  5) of course, doing some contributions if possible since I always want to be a great scientist but I know my university work is very busy. However, after attending the first GYA, I felt great. I get to know multi-national and multi-disciplinary people. We all working together to tackle or voice out our opinions on the global issue, particularly science environment for young scientists. The most important, I learn about how members from different education system work effectively and also learn about their culture in daily life. I also find that what we are doing is very meaningful as a scientist. A scientist should not just publish as many papers as he-she can without considering the impact. Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference. In those conferences, friendship is not really built while in GYA AGM, we build the friendship because we work together on something voluntarily. After the second time attending AGM, I love it so much and till now I have never missed any AGM yet. In a few meeting with GYA members through Skype, I learnt that the chair controls the time very well within one hour. Also, I learnt that something looks tough can be slowly dissolved through step by step planning and  discussing of ideas. Note that, though my PhD supervisor is from the University of Cambridge, my entire education was carried out in Asia. I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet. The reasons are not having enough experience in this kind of organisation, as well as not enough time for my career. I am still striving to earn enough monthly salary for my family.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,296
"I came to know about the GYA during a meeting of TWAS young affiliates. It is sister like-minded organization.

What I enjoy most about GYA provides a platform for border-less interaction (in academic and social events) of scholars from different disciplines which is not quite possible in the conventional research environment that I have experienced.

When I became a member, my expectations were more than fulfilled: I found myself among like-minded committed young scholars who did not only do great work but were also wonderful persons. I think that the ""commitment to service"" criterium in the selection process is absolutely essential.

However, I wondered what might it be that will make an AGM special for me. Looking back, there were three main aspects, I would like to summarized here, that made my AGM special and different from other conferences:     - The AGM provides GYA members with a longed for and needed opportunity to come and work together in person. This helps create a network and foundation for later long-distance work, but, moreover, helps to find common values and to identify shared ideas that can guide member activities throughout the year.    - The AGM combines an annual meeting (needed for organisational discussions or working group meetings) and a interdisciplinary scientific conference. Everything happens in a multidisciplinary and multicultural space. Attendees think and talk about familiar and new ideas, about how to apply familiar ideas to new areas, and explore the scope for new cooperation across disciplines, countries and cultures. There is not enough time to follow-up on all stimulating input, and impulses from the AGM last beyond the meeting.    - The AGM helps learning by living what it means that the GYA is a member driven organisation, the opportunities and challenges that come with it. It is a place that allows to experience the spirit of the GYA and to learn that it is okay to say, I do not know yet know but would learn how to be an active part of the GYA.

Although the AGM themes usually are usually not related to my research field (which I think I cannot get any input for my research aspect), although if I attend GYA AGM, I will not have any chance to be sponsored by the university for another oversea academic conference anymore for that year, and although I had applied for a few research funding with GYA members but yet to get anyone, I still choose to attend GYA AGM every year rather than the conventional academic conference.

In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective.

"This is the speech I gave at the AGM in Eindhoven, which describes some of my story (at the bottom is a link to a related blogpost as well): 

The Global Young Academy has changed my life. And I don<U+FFFD>t mean the 14,003 emails that passed through my inbox in the past two years as of this morning. Those changed my <U+FFFD>daily<U+FFFD> life. 

No I mean it: the GYA has changed my life, my life course. 

Three weeks ago I was in South-Africa to help with the second edition of the Africa Science Leadership Program. It<U+FFFD>s a program to build leadership capacity in Africa and to shape the science system. The fellows came from around the continent. Angola, Egypt, Kenia, Nigeria, Mauritius. Many of them have big plans. A meteorite scientist from Morocco wants to set up an African Space Agency. You can<U+FFFD>t say that that<U+FFFD>s not a vision. 

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas. There is still work to do there, but these are marginal improvements in comparison. So I am changing direction.  

My shift in direction is credit to the GYA. This organization does make change happen, starting on a very personal level.

Epilogue: in the past few years, an all very much related to the GYA, I have conducted several projects related to the topic of refugees and migration. With the efforts of others, this has culminated in the GYAs mentoring program for refugee scholars (and related activities), a documentary in which the GYA features, an academic symposium on integration of refugees and migrants and a forthcoming interdisciplinary edited volume ""Responsibility for Refugee and Migrant Integration"" with Jan-Christoph Heilinger and Karly Kehoe. In all these activities, scholars with a refugee background have been actively involved and vocal about what they find important.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,326

The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,331
The most positive aspect of the GYA for me is the interaction with scholars from across disciplines working on important global questions.

However, I would like to share a story when I received the survey from the people in charge of the funding proposal for a GloSYS Latin America. To certain point, filling the form was like a sort of usual formality. But what strikes me, -for good-, is when as a follow up message, Karen Wiemann contacted me asking for my inputs ans ideas on the current status of Latin American young scientific community. She was really eager to know the situation in my region, so I inmediatly thought that it was not ""just a burocratic"" form, so there is actual serious concern on that situation.

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas.

"The workshop organised by Sasha Kagansky in Edinburgh on artistic representation of science was most insightful and a formative experience that taught me that there is always science and arts, and always arts in science. Since then, I no longer feel comfortable being tagged as ""scientist"", which seems to narrow.    In particular, we learned that an ""artistic choice"" is required to convert scientific measurements into sound, but it is a choice that scientists make all the time when creating ""statistics"" of raw data. It is not a straightforward deterministic process.     This has added to me arguing for a holistic approach, viewing science as a humanity rather than restricting the human endeavour to ""disciplines"".

"As a white European scholar, the topic of ""trust in science"" meant certain things to me that I thought I understood more or less: skepticism of the ""elite"", the problem of money in academia etc. But when I discussed it with GYA members from other countries, I realized that it is much broader and more multi-faceted. I can mean lack of trust because of a perception that academics plagiarize each others work. It can mean lack of trustworthiness on the part of (young) scientists because of a lack of mentorship that would support them in their endeavors. And it can mean distrust in Western (!) science if those who preach it dont follow their own principles (e.g. not taking local medical treatment, which they offer to the local population, but being flown away when they catch a disease themselves). In my efforts to build the ""Trust in (Young) Scientists"" working group, this broader perspective has been extremely important for me.

I have never been nurtured by the western style of daring to voice out my opinion or daring to create a project to solve global issue etc. (Note: though many GYA members are from Asia, Africa and South America, they have studied in western countries) Furthermore, my English is not good. Through a few years of GYA membership, I observed and learnt this western characteristic gradually. To appreciate GYA, I involved in a few committee posts so that I make contributions as well. This year, I even accepted the challenge to be a co-lead of a working group. I have not had the courage to run for an EC post yet. The reasons are not having enough experience in this kind of organisation, as well as not enough time for my career. I am still striving to earn enough monthly salary for my family.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,359
"The GYA has enabled me to be connected with some of the most exciting minds I have every met. I have had the privilege of attending a number of great educational institutions, and to be post-doc or employed at a number of many others. Nowhere have I met the range, depth and enthusiasm and internationalism of attendees like at one of the annual general meetings. I have made connections (I hope) for life at the GYA.        -  ANother story would be the possibility of becoming engaged hands-on in matters related to the Sustainable Development Goals. I have had the honor to participate in various IAP meetings of the SCience for Poverty Eradication Committee (Beijing, Halle) and was able to connect to scholars here working on the question of how science can best inform the implementation of the SDGs. I hope that I was able to make several suggestions in all these fora that could strengthen SDG implementation and improve the networking of science academies working towards SDG implementation (as some of my research is on SDG governance, this was extra helpful). ---> please help edit this story if you like to use it, we can fine.-tune or tailor it",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,360

I meet colleagues from others countries so I learned how they are organized in their National Young Academy (NYA). When I went back I decided to create a NYA. So I contacted the secretary of the Senior Academy of Science whom is ready to help me and he is helping me to set NYA in my country. As member of the GYA, I got accepted to participate in a workshop in Beijing (China). Here, I met the executive director of the Integrated Research for Disaster Risk (IRDR) who is ready to help me set a create a research center on disaster management.

"The process of establishing and supporting and being part of the Science Leadership Programs has been hugely influential for me.

It has been fantastic to meet so many of our SLP fellows and get to know them over the course of an intensive week, and keep in touch with them over time. It has been inspirational to work with people like Bernard Slippers, who has a big vision for improving the state of science and its contribution to society in Africa.

I was recently involved in putting up a proposal for the Africa Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) Project on behalf of my University. This project involves the participation of regional and international collaborators. It was not difficult getting willing and capable collaborators from Ghana, Mauritius, Senegal and Zimbabwe from my GYA connections. The good news is that the bidding was successful. On another note the GYA has over the years enhanced my skills of mentorship, science communication and diplomacy through training opportunities that have been provided over the years. This has impacted positively on my voluntary support to younger scientists, collaborators and my national young academy, especially when I served as President of the body for 2 years. GYA gatherings were always opportunities to strengthen my ideas and have insights into new ideas which were always brought back home to drive one initiative or the other in my national young academy. Through these motivations, I was able to get a grant from the US Consulate in the commercial nerve centre of my Country to organise a capacity building workshop for young-early career women scientists in my country. My national young academy, with the support of the senior academy, thereafter got an IAP grant to replicate the workshop on a larger scale for young-early career women scientists in West Africa. It turned out to be a very successful event.

"Leadership skills would have to be my second greatest benefit from the GYA. This is from two separate fronts.    The first is through the ASLP, learning skills of thought clustering, PPCO and effective feedback of ideas. Active listening, and how to maximise the contribution of everyone in the groups to develop innovative ideas. Ive used these skills in my own group, my institute, for GYA events at the AGM and within my work group. These have truly changed how I problem solve.     The second is negotiation skills developed though watching the interaction of member from different countries. The greatest example of have of this is being in Morocco with my work group and after a way of work we headed to the markets. One of members, who spoke arabic, although not their first language, did the bargaining for us.  There was always a lot of conversation and laughing before any negotiation on price occurred. To get the best price, they first developed a relationship with the store holder, found out about their family, and then used me and the fact that if they didnt give me they price I wanted then my friend would have to pay the difference. Thus, they leveraged the store owners humanity, not to adversely impact them, whilst they were trying to help me. And they did this by first developing a connecting with the owner.  It is a simple display of humanity and relationships and how to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. And I think of it every time I Iook at the rug in my lounge!",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,368

"If I think about the greatest lasting effect of the GYA on me as a person, excluding benefits only to my career, the most significant impact the GYA has had on me is the network of friends I have built who are passionate about improving society through the work they do and the activities they volunteer on and they way they have changed my thinking.    Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,374
"GYA co-organised the ASEAN Science Leadership Programme in Kuala Lumpur in 2017 and I was one of the participants. This event has a positive impact on me as it opened the door for me to know many researchers in the ASEAN region. I learned a lot from this event and it also allowed me to learn what other Young Academies in the region are doing. One of the projects that came out from the ASEAN Science Leadership Programme is the Responsible Conduct of Research Programme. After some planning and with the strong support of GYA members in the ASEAN region, ASEAN has established the ASEAN Young Scientists Network and the Responsible Conduct of Research Programme will be one of the key programmes of this ASEAN network.     In addition, I feel that the existence of GYA is very important because it acts as a cohesive network for all other Young Academies. It makes all the Young Academies feel that we are part of a larger global community. When I talk about my own Young Academy, which I often do, I always talk about how our Young Academy is also part of GYA and that gives our Young Academy more credibility and clout.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,375

In contrast, in 2016, it was all mixed.     I much enjoyed learning more about a large number of countries to which I did not have any connection before. Moreover, it is instructive to see how people in places that are geographically far separated are affected by similar issues, and how this works out with the specific local context.     In my opinion, this experience has proven the notion that there are issues for developing countries and other issues for developed countries plainly wrong, and the GYA should not promote such a distinction.

Many of them have big plans. A meteorite scientist from Morocco wants to set up an African Space Agency. You can<U+FFFD>t say that that<U+FFFD>s not a vision. 

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas. There is still work to do there, but these are marginal improvements in comparison. So I am changing direction.

"If I think about the greatest lasting effect of the GYA on me as a person, excluding benefits only to my career, the most significant impact the GYA has had on me is the network of friends I have built who are passionate about improving society through the work they do and the activities they volunteer on and they way they have changed my thinking.    Bring a part of the GYA is inspirational. Sometimes it can be overwhelming as you compare yourself to the achievements of others, but generally this is inspiring!! What I have actually found is that we often judge ourselves compared to the achievements of others (in this very successful group) but when you speak to anyone, they have the same sense about you. Perhaps it is the feeling that we are bigger than our parts. That we can work together to come up with really novel interdisciplinary and truly global responses to pressing issues. The global perspective is one of the greatest benefits I have felt from these interactions with colleagues.   To give one specific story, will be the ECs response to the request from our funders to have a GYA initiative in response to the EU immigrations crisis.  In 2016 there was so much media attention on immigration of refugees of war into europe, and how europe was going to deal with this crisis. Whilst the fleeing of thousands of innocent people from war was truly a humanitarian crisis, the perspective in the media came more from this being a social crisis for the countries to which the immigrant were feeling, that they now had to deal with.  Thus, when the GYA held a meeting regarding europes response to this immigrate crisis, EC members from Africa countries brought to the table their objection to just an initiative, given the millions of refugees of war that Africa countries have been supporting for  years, with no media attention. Thier perspective was that in their countries, refugees were brought in and supported as brothers and sisters in need, not as invaders.   This discussion will remain with me forever and continues to highlight the advantage to understanding a different perspective to global issues. but more importantly, the need to ensure that Europe and America do not dominate the conversation and perspective. That we continue to draw on the perspectives from a diverse experience.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,395

I learned a lot from this event and it also allowed me to learn what other Young Academies in the region are doing. One of the projects that came out from the ASEAN Science Leadership Programme is the Responsible Conduct of Research Programme. After some planning and with the strong support of GYA members in the ASEAN region, ASEAN has established the ASEAN Young Scientists Network and the Responsible Conduct of Research Programme will be one of the key programmes of this ASEAN network.     In addition, I feel that the existence of GYA is very important because it acts as a cohesive network for all other Young Academies. It makes all the Young Academies feel that we are part of a larger global community. When I talk about my own Young Academy, which I often do, I always talk about how our Young Academy is also part of GYA and that gives our Young Academy more credibility and clout.",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,411
"GYA influence is mainly through conferences where Young Academies Members meet and exchange ideas and discuss global issues, also GYA has been key information of Young Academies especially in countries where even the Senior Academy does not exist. GYA has assisted in drafting constitutions of Young academies around the world by providing a template which they can align and adopt some of the universal requirements in the global academy.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,412
"When I became a member of INYAS, and then the GYA, I was going through a long and very stressful phase in my career. I was constantly being discriminated against by the Director of my institute and was being refused tenure in spite of my having a better performance than most of the tenured colleagues in my department. This is because I was a woman with an ambition, who refused to bow down and beg before the authorities. Being accepted as a member of the GYA gave me immense confidence boost, as did the successful founding of INYAS. When I attended the GYA AGM and interacted with people all across the globe, I had extremely satisfying discussions that opened up new vistas of thought for me, and helped me to dream bigger. This helped to put the negativities at the institute behind me and look forward. On a different note, my experience at the GYA gave me ideas, sometimes subtle ones, that could be incorporated in the functioning of INYAS. As I got involved with the GYA, I spoke to friends and colleagues in India about it, and promoted the GYA through social media. It is now very satisfying to see the increasing interest in India about the GYA, which is also reflected in the GYA membership. Especially satisfying for me is the fact that in the last two years, two INYAS members have been selected to be members of the GYA.",1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,413
"This is the speech I gave at the AGM in Eindhoven, which describes some of my story (at the bottom is a link to a related blogpost as well): 

The Global Young Academy has changed my life. And I don<U+FFFD>t mean the 14,003 emails that passed through my inbox in the past two years as of this morning. Those changed my <U+FFFD>daily<U+FFFD> life. 

No I mean it: the GYA has changed my life, my life course. 

Three weeks ago I was in South-Africa to help with the second edition of the Africa Science Leadership Program. It<U+FFFD>s a program to build leadership capacity in Africa and to shape the science system. The fellows came from around the continent. Angola, Egypt, Kenia, Nigeria, Mauritius. Many of them have big plans. A meteorite scientist from Morocco wants to set up an African Space Agency. You can<U+FFFD>t say that that<U+FFFD>s not a vision. 

It was not the first time I was in South-Africa or with the ASLP, but this time the conversations I had, they caused a whirlwind in my head. They made me realize that I need to change research direction, focus more on big problems such as the current migration crisis and the wellbeing of those people who are on the move. I<U+FFFD>m a psychologist and I work on how people traumatic experiences, especially young people. But I have done that mostly in highly resourced areas. There is still work to do there, but these are marginal improvements in comparison. So I am changing direction.  

My shift in direction is credit to the GYA. This organization does make change happen, starting on a very personal level.

Epilogue: in the past few years, an all very much related to the GYA, I have conducted several projects related to the topic of refugees and migration. With the efforts of others, this has culminated in the GYAs mentoring program for refugee scholars (and related activities), a documentary in which the GYA features, an academic symposium on integration of refugees and migrants and a forthcoming interdisciplinary edited volume ""Responsibility for Refugee and Migrant Integration"" with Jan-Christoph Heilinger and Karly Kehoe. In all these activities, scholars with a refugee background have been actively involved and vocal about what they find important.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,414

"The GYA has been very helpful in my work as Chair of a National Young Academy. I have been in constant touch with various members of the GYA who have been an important resource in helping me to build the organizational capacity as well as increase societal impact of my Young Academy. GYA members have been a source a great ideas and guidance so far. They have also helped to connect me, personally, to important opportunities for scientific and leadership development.",1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,416
"The GYA has impacted immensely on my personal and career development, professional network, capability to impact positively on young scientists, collaborators and my national young academy. In one respect, my professional network has greatly grown with my membership of the GYA with enhanced latitude for collaborative research and engagement. I was recently involved in putting up a proposal for the Africa Centres of Excellence for Development Impact (ACE Impact) Project on behalf of my University. This project involves the participation of regional and international collaborators. It was not difficult getting willing and capable collaborators from Ghana, Mauritius, Senegal and Zimbabwe from my GYA connections. The good news is that the bidding was successful. On another note the GYA has over the years enhanced my skills of mentorship, science communication and diplomacy through training opportunities that have been provided over the years. This has impacted positively on my voluntary support to younger scientists, collaborators and my national young academy, especially when I served as President of the body for 2 years. GYA gatherings were always opportunities to strengthen my ideas and have insights into new ideas which were always brought back home to drive one initiative or the other in my national young academy. Through these motivations, I was able to get a grant from the US Consulate in the commercial nerve centre of my Country to organise a capacity building workshop for young-early career women scientists in my country. My national young academy, with the support of the senior academy, thereafter got an IAP grant to replicate the workshop on a larger scale for young-early career women scientists in West Africa. It turned out to be a very successful event. My involvements in working group activities, the planning and execution of the 2nd Africa Young Academies Regional Conference in Mauritius, the GloSYS Africa Project etc. have greatly sharpened by team work, leadership and collaborative engagement skills. My membership and involvements in the GYA also opened many doors of opportunities for me for personal and professional development.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,417

"One of the main outcomes from my involvement in the GYA was broadening my horizons as a scientist. It was incredibly motivating to meet scientists from developing countries, to understand the challenges they face, and to understand how science can be a unifying framework for change. I maintain many friendships from my time with the GYA and these have also been useful professionally. I recall Bernard Slippers visiting me in Cambridge when his university was looking to design a new institute, and he was able to meet with several senior university officials here to receive advice and to have discussions, interactions that would not have been possible without our prior engagement through the GYA.     I also sit on several committees at Cambridge that look at admission and funding for undergraduate and postgraduate students. I have found that the understanding I have developed of scientific education around the world through my interactions at the GYA has been enormously helpful in this role.",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,419
"In the context that I am showing below (copy of an email *), I participated in a GYA meeting for the first time. For me it was very important to share with colleagues the different common scientific problems. In addition, it was very pleasant to think and share common objectives so that, in the immediate future, we can develop an inclusive, diverse and service-oriented science for the people. On my return from the CILAC forum and the Scientific Leadership training workshop prior to the conference (GYA), I gave a seminar with my work group and my students. Now we are working on concrete activities to include different topics tackled in CILAC and in GYA in our progarams of studies and our research activities. I think GYA is an excellent way to think, to discuss generating concrete actions that improve scientific activity. Therefore I will be happy to share experiences as a member of GYA.
