"KYM-20","B1","I had gone to Saudi Arabia 3 years ago and returned back 6 months ago due to leg pain."
"KYM-20","C3","We don’t have any land for agriculture so we are not involved in any farming activities. Hence our income is dependent on daily wage labour. I had gone Saudi but I could not earn enough and had to return back due to health issues."
"KYM-20","D6","We need to spend more for food as it is growing fast. So income and expenses are same. The income that we generate from pig is enough for taking care of pigs itself. We are not able to gain their weight as they need to have proper foods which we are unable to provide. This is the reason that we have  not increased the number of pig and the income from pig has also not increased."
"KYM-20","E4","Labour charge has gone up and we are four people to work so it has increased but still price of goods have also increased."
"KYM-20","F3","Income and spending is parallel. We don’t have much income. Also we don’t have land for agriculture. The land that we have is given by government under mukta kamaiya scheme. We have to buy everything for survival may be these days we can spend money on good clothing and meat products. But otherwise I do not think much has changed so not sure."
"KYF-4","C1","We have kept some goats and pigs for income generation. Beside that we used to farm vegetables, wheat and paddy for own consumption but now we have left agriculture because husband and son go for the labour work, one son is in abroad and one son and daughter in law is busy on their shop so we now have left agriculture because of less man power."
"KYF-4","C3","Now a days we are not doing agriculture work as there is lack of man power. My sons have their own work and husband also goes for labour work for earning. We do not have our own land for farming. We did sharecropping previously. Now a days we do not do it."
"KYF-4","C5","As we have left agriculture there is no production these days. We have to buy everything."
"KYF-4","D6","We give pig dietary food and also waste food of our house with vitamins for weight gain but as we have lack of man power to look after pigs we have reduced the number of pigs but the income has increased as the price of meat compared to past five year have increased."
"KYF-4","E1","My husband goes to labour work. One son has gone to abroad. Daughter in law and son has got a shop and other son also works as a labour. We stop agriculture because of lack of manpower. Previously we did farming on sharecropping basis but this work is changed. Now we are involved in other income generating work."
"KYF-4","E4","My one son has opened a grocery shop. Another son sends remittance, husband goes to labour work and other son also works as a labour so we have left agriculture work that’s why we can say that the income from non farming and non agricultural work has been increased."
"KYF-4","F3","We spend more on food and education and also some times need to visit to the doctor for my leg pain, so we need to be very much conscious on what we are spending on. But good thing is that my children are in undergraduate now."
"KYF-4","F5","I don’t know about the control. We only spend on what is most like food, education, clothes, medicines and all the decision is made by my husband as well. Also my elder son have recently build a house so we don’t have any saving or any other extra spending. Decisions are taken by my husband."
"KYF-4","F8","From my elder son's earning we have built a house. We need to spend for education as well as for food thus we are not able to save money and I don’t know if my sons and daughter in law are saving or not. But we  have recently build a house so we don’t have any saving now. So in terms of assets the house is the asset."
"KYF-4","H2","I am experiencing the same situation. May be it will get better after we have some saving once all my kids are out from the college after studying and start working. All our son is getting educated so that is good for me and family."
"KYF-4","H4","Our situation is slightly changed as we have got a modern house. Good earning but not saving enough to choose and do what ever we like to have."
"KYF-12","B3","These days awareness has increased on health issues. If anybody became ill we go to hospital immediately."
"KYF-12","C1","We have not started any new production. Rather we continue what we used to do earlier. We produce rice, wheat, vegetable for self. Now a days production has been increased due to irrigation facility, hybrid seeds and use of fertilizer."
"KYF-12","C3","We use fertilizer, hybrid seeds, and irrigation facility is good thus production level is increased. At the same time selling price of grain is also increased thus income of our household has also increased."
"KYF-12","C5","Yes as we have good irrigation facility and use of hybrid seeds with fertilizer gives more production. Nowadays it is not only for household consumption but we sell grains as well."
"KYF-12","D6","Rearing pig is becoming difficult. We do not have sufficient money to buy vitamins and other food items from the market. We have to depend on left over food to provide to pigs or make extra kole (traditionally made food) for pigs. At the same time viral allergy has been seen in pigs. So rearing pig and piglet is becoming difficult. We still follow what we used to do from generations. So we are unable to gain weight of pigs. We have also decreased the number of pigs as my husband goes for labour work and I also need to look after children so we have decreased the number of pigs.  As we have decreased the number of pigs, our income from pigs has also decreased."
"KYF-12","E1","My husband earn money from labour work. We sell paddy and wheat in the market. Before we both used to look after pigs but the income is not so satisfying so we have decreased the number of pigs and husband have started doing labour work."
"KYF-12","E4","From labor work the income is better than income from pigs, so we have decreased the number of pigs and started labour work."
"KYF-12","F3","We spend on what we used to do in the past. Mainly extra expenses are on children's education."
"KYF-12","H2","Yes I am getting  good medical treatment in case of illness, We have good bonding in family. So I am happy in these days."
"KYF-12","H4","Though we don’t have saving but children are getting education so we are happy. We have a good and peaceful environment in our family. We have sufficient food thus we don’t have any problem at all."
"KYF-10","A13","Grand daughter was born recently. One daughter got married and also son had gone to abroad but returned back because of health issue. And also I have serious health issue (stone in kidney)."
"KYF-10","B3","I have gone through operation for stone four times. My son has suffered from jaundice many times and he is using medicine until now. He had gone to abroad for work but he is now at home. He returned from abroad because of heath issues."
"KYF-10","C3","I have introduced a new species of rice seed. Also now fertilizer is available locally.  We are harvesting new seed which has increased our production level. Increase in production results to increase in income as we sell stocked  produce in the market which we don’t consume."
"KYF-10","C5","My sons are grown up and they are also helping us on farm. We are using modern equipment's for cultivation and  harvesting. And also use of new species of seeds of rice is giving more production."
"KYF-10","D6","Due to various diseases related to pig we are not getting benefit to the extent we had hoped. Previously here was health issues with pig. We provided medicine for pig but pig did not get cure. The allergy of pig caused in death of  piglet. We had to bear loss in pig farming. That is the reason we are not focusing on pig farming."
"KYF-10","E1","previously when my son was abroad for sometime  we used to get remittance. Beside this we get money by selling the paddy and wheat in the market. My other son works as a labour that also add to overall household income."
"KYF-10","E2","It has changed but has not contributed a lot to saving. On top we don’t have proper income from pig farming and agriculture work is done for self use and remaining some are sold in market. One son does the labour work but our expenses is high as we need to spend more on medicines."
"KYF-10","E4","In the past we used to get remittance. Now one son works as a labour so some how income has increased. At the same time expenses has also increased to some extent as I frequently need to visit hospital and also one son need to take regular medicines."
"KYF-10","F1","Yes it has been changed. We purchased TV, cycle. Our food behavior has also changed. We spend lots of money for medical purpose. We even spend some money for marriage ceremony."
"KYF-10","F3","Over all consumption in the household has increased so expenses has gone up as well. Apart from that I am not being able to earn as my health condition is worst and we need to spend more on medicine."
"KYF-10","F5","We are conscious on what we spend on because we need to control our spending as we have more spending on hospital bills. This has contributed to change in spending type."
"KYF-10","F8","We don’t have any saving. We purchased some assets but our hospital bill is high so we don’t have any saving."
"KYF-10","H2","As I frequently need to visit doctor and I don’t have any personal income so it is worst."
"KYF-21","B1","Son was born 11 month ago, husband gone abroad but returned because of low income and high labour work."
"KYF-21","C1","We grow wheat and paddy. There is no any new farming activities. Our production has decreased because of lack of manpower as husband works as a labour and I need to look after children."
"KYF-21","C3","Because of less production due to decreased volume of land cultivation for agriculture work."
"KYF-21","C5","Due to lack of manpower we are not able to harvest properly and this is contributing to production. This is in deteriorating trend."
"KYF-21","D2","We decided not to have pigs. The reason behind was not having time to look after them."
"KYF-21","D6","We don’t have pig any more. As husband goes for labour work and I need to look after children and also the income from pig is not so satisfying so we left rearing pigs."
"KYF-21","E1","Husband works as a labour in construction site. I have to look after children so we have stopped pig breeding and also decreased volume of farming. So even our agricultural production has gone down. We want to keep pig but right now we don’t have money for that.  Husband had gone abroad but returned because of low income and his current earning is not enough so that we could save money."
"KYF-21","E2","In my case it is no. I don’t work any more. I just look after the children. Only husband works as a labour and we are surviving on that. We do not have  pigs so apart from farming only income is labour work. We don’t have money and also there is no any support program neither from government sector or non governmental sector so out income has not improved."
"KYF-21","F1","We are spending more on children's education and medication. We have stopped spending on pig rearing. There is only husband who works as a labour and earn which we need to spend on everything so we don’t have saving. Its even hard for our livelihood. There are three cooperative established from women's group which provide easy loan, and we also have some loan."
"KYF-21","F3","Its even hard for managing livelihood. The reason for decrease is that we all depend on income of my husband and I need to look after children's so I don’t have time to work on field or as a labour."
"KYF-21","F8","We don’t have any saving but we need to take loan in emergency situations and also we are planning to sell our land because we need more money for livelihood and children's education. We are in debt."
"KYF-21","G1","We have good relationship in our home.  Earlier we used to have some conflict as there was no more income and husband used to drink alcohol but now its peaceful and cooperative."
"KYF-19","C1","We grow wheat, paddy. We use new technology of farming. Now instead of bull we use tractor for ploughing land. Now we are using hybrid seed and fertilizer so production level has increased."
"KYF-19","C5","Due to use of hybrid seed and fertilizer on time."
"KYF-19","D2","We built shelter for pig and we are more conscious on cleaness, Village development committee have provided 4 days training on it. But these days we only have one pig which is pregnant and also is suffering from viral allergy."
"KYF-19","D6","before we used to keep male pig for mating and breeding but now we have female only. It is difficult to get weight of female pigs. The pig which we have now is also suffering from allergy and is also pregnant. We have decreased number of pigs because now a days we are busy on tailoring work."
"KYF-19","E1","Now a days we are doing tailoring work so we have decreased number of pigs and also reduced agriculture work."
"KYF-19","E4","The money we earn need to spend on brother's education and also we need to buy other household things."
"KYF-19","F1","We spend money for our livelihood, brother's education and in case of medical purpose. Beside this we spend money to purchase seed and fertilizer. Brother is studying hotel management course which requires more money so our most of the income is spent on brother's education."
"KYF-9","C1","We usually grow wheat and paddy, taking about new farming activities we use hybrid seeds these days which increases the food production and also overall time spend on farming have decreased. The amount of  production from farming is for self use only . We don't have any new plan, lets believe in god."
"KYF-9","C3","What we produce is  hardly sufficient for us. After our family separation we got small plot of land. And the production from the land would hardly be sufficient for us."
"KYF-9","C5","In my experience while we used to live in joint family, Before using hybrid seed our family member have insufficient food at home so every year we had to buy food for some month. But after we started using hybrid seeds and fertilizer  we never faced that problem again."
"KYF-9","D1","No. We recently have got fragment from joint family to nuclear family. But we are planning to keep some pigs after building pig shelter."
"KYF-9","D2","We don’t have pig now. But I can share my experience when we were in joint family. We had a few pigs but in the last few years it has been difficult to keep pig out of sickness and it has contributed to death of pigs and also loosing of income especially in my family."
"KYF-9","D6","Because these days we don’t have pigs now. In my view from pig farming, there is no such benefit what we think after selling pigs. Food, vitamin, medicine for pig is so expensive. The only profit that we get from pig is at the time of selling we get money in lump sum which we can invest some where else. But not all households are able to materialize this opportunity. We have not been able to do so in the past when we sold pig while being in a joint family."
"KYF-9","E2","Yes I earn from rattail shop which yields quite good income. Myself and my husband together run the shop."
"KYF-9","E4","Before we are dependent on agriculture. But now we have retail shop which is enough for family livelihood especially for a small family like ours."
"KYF-9","F1","We spend money for daily livelihood and child education. We are not able to save more but are engaged in saving and credit cooperative. We have some loan while establishing our shop."
"KYF-9","F3","Before family separation, my husband used to give all earning to his father and his father used to decide on where to spend. But now after family separation every pressure we share together. We discuss together and take decision. We have to manage all the income and expenses."
"KYF-9","F8","We saved money and took also loan to establish shop for livelihood."
"KYF-9","H2","its enough to look after livelihood and also have to consider about loan payment so these days I am having a bit pressure."
"KNM-13","B3","Nowadays , there is easy access to medical facility and we are getting nutritious food and also we are aware about various dieseases. So no health issues in the family."
"KNM-13","C1","Yes, I have changed the pattern of farming. Earlier we were limited on rice and wheat production. Now we are farming cash crops. Now we are farming mushroom as well as vegetable products. For this I had taken trainnning from the district agriculture office. Now a  days I am so busy on farming vegetables and mushroom from which I am earning good income."
"KNM-13","C3","I am doing good with mushroom and vegetable farming. In Some of the land I even grow wheat and paddy for household consumption. So my expenses has decresed on staple grains and income has increased."
"KNM-13","C5","We,  all family member give lots of time in the field, at the same time we use hybrid seeds and chemical fertilizer thus in the limited land also we produce large amount of grain which is sufficient for our household consumption. At the same time remaining grain stock is sold in the market. Now a days we dont have problem with the vegetables too. And we get regular income from selling vegetable produce."
"KNM-13","D2","Initially we made a modern type of shelter for pigs. But it is difficult to feed proper food to the pigs. Food for pigs in the market is costly. Thus we stopped purchasing food and started feeding pigs in tradiional way that is available in the home. While breeding we use traditional way. We use to take a pig in the neighbours home and breed it. But we have decreased the numbers of pigs because there is not so much income from pigs as we are not being able to feed them with proper diet from market, and also there are various diseases seen in pigs which even causes death of pig."
"KNM-13","D6","Earlier we kept 32 pigs in our house. But now we have only 2 pigs. We are not satisfied with the income from pigs. It is hard to gain the weight of pig and the cost of food is also high. Thus we sold all the 30 pigs and have started mushroom and vegetable farming."
"KNM-13","E1","Earlier we used to keet pigs in large number. But now we decreased the number of pigs. Now we are focusing on agriculture, particullarly mushroom farming and vegetable farming from these we are getting cash directly. We are planning to increse the mushroom farm rather than keeping pigs."
"KNM-13","E2","Yes the proportion of income increased in the last five years as mushroom farming and vegetable farming is better then farming rice and wheat. Rice and wheat is only cultivated for household consumption. Also in terms of pigs there is no proper pig farm in nearby area. Medical facilities for pigs are not available easily and it is also costly, so we have introduced mushroom farming with some vegetable and the income from these are good."
"KNM-13","F1","Yes, it has changed over the years. Nowadays our expenditure for household is  increased. We spend our money for education of children, clothes for family. There is nothing on which we have stoped spending money like earlier. But now we need to spend on mushroom tunnels, seeds, vegetable tunnels, seeds, fertilizers etc. The surplus money after household consumption are put for saving in the bank."
"KNM-13","F3","We have purchased TV, Fan and motor bike. Beside this we spend large amount of money  for the mushroom farm and education of children. Basically we have added to luxury items in the household."
"KNM-13","F5","I mean mostly we need to spend on daily consumption and we have got other assets like bike for transportation and TV for intertainment. Also besides that now we spend on mushroom and vegetable farm only. So I do have control over spending and what is needed we do buy from the market."
"KNM-13","F8","We purchased some assets like motorbike and  TV. At the same time we have some saving in the bank too. But we are not able to save more because we need to spend for our mushroom and vegetable farming."
"KNM-13","H2","Now I have a good income. I  take part in various social activities. In the time of  emergency I can manage some money, I also have some saving and good income from mushroom and vegetable farming."
"KNM-13","H4","We all family member share the work. Now our income level has increased. Children are geeting good education. And we are living happily. We also have some saving for any crisis."
"KNF-2","C1","We are continuing with our traditional way of farming. We grow paddy, wheat and vegetable for own consumption purposes. The volume in which we produce is enough for our household consumption. Besides that the remaining produced grain we sell in the mill. From this earning we manage oil, salt and so on for household consumption. We use bull as a means for ploughing land. Nowadays we are using hybrid seeds so some production is increasing. Recently  we have started keeping a few goats and a cow in our house. This would add in income in the future."
"KNF-2","C5","Due to the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer the production has increased from which we manage to buy spices and other consumable kitchen items. But this increase is not extensive so that we can save."
"KNF-2","D1","Yes in the past I had pigs. Now we don’t have any because the pigs died of viral diseases and there was nothing that we could do."
"KNF-2","D2","No, I don’t farm pig now. While we had pig we used to feed  them with food available in the home and we used the traditional way of farming and breeding pigs but now we don’t have any pigs as they died we now don’t want to do pig farming anymore."
"KNF-2","E4","Now my spouse and son are earning from driving occupation and labor work so our income is increased these days."
"KNF-2","F3","Because of increase in income from spouse and sons, and also some times some money comes from farming. This is the reason that our income has increased."
"KNM-1","B3","The reason for good health of  my family member is that we are consuming healthy and balanced food. We visit doctor in case of any illness and we are more conscious about our health and also there is proper health facility now."
"KNM-1","C1","We are doing seasonal vegetable farming. Along with farming we are continuing our paddy and wheat farming. From vegetable we have increased our income. A part of our land we use for vegetable farming and the remaining land is used for wheat and paddy production. This is our staple grain. We use fertilizer and hybrid seed thus production has also increased. Grain we produce is enough to feed our family member."
"KNM-1","C3","As I am doing vegetable farming. My brother is busy in his business and another brother works  as a employee in the office thus the amount of money is increased."
"KNM-1","C5","Along with vegetable our traditional farming (paddy, wheat and maize) is same. As I already mention we use fertilizer and hybrid seed thus the production is also increased."
"KNM-1","D2","We are using the traditional method of farming. But nowadays we also provide them with various medicines and vitamins on a regular basis. Family members take care of the pigs. By using vitamins the pig has increased its volume too. We serve them the waste food of our family. We sell them at the village."
"KNM-1","D6","We give vitamin diet and medicine to the pig time and again. It has increased the weight of pig. At the same time the market price of meat is also increased. I only rear one pig, I don’t want to increase its number because it will be more costly and pigs take more time, so one pig is good for me."
"KNM-1","E1","My family has started the business i.e. retail shop. And I have started vegetable farming. At the same time salary of my brother has supported in increase of the income of my family."
"KNM-1","E2","Yes my income has increased. Earlier I used to sell the rice and wheat but now I am seling vegetables, and vegetables have  better income than rice. This business I do in the local market."
"KNM-1","E4","We all three brothers are engaged in different income generating activities. Vegetable farming, income from business and salary from service is the reason for increased amount of money of my household earning."
"KNM-1","F1","Yes it has changed. We spend money for the livilihood,motorbike, mobile phone,TV, refregerator etc. Our father decide what to spend money on . We  give our income to father and he manage it. But while we need the goods for us we purchase ourself. The remaining money we save at bank for future. In this 5 year time period we took a loan to establish bussiness. At the same time my wife had to go through medical treatment to  deliver a baby."
"KNM-1","F3","To meet the needs of today's life style we spend our money on mobile phone, motorbike, TV because we also have good income now."
"KNM-1","F8","The value of land has increased. I have purchased various assets thus I feeel that the total value of my assects has increased. Such as motor bike, tv, refregerator etc and we are spending on our household thing and also we need to buy vegetable seeds so now we don’t have saving but soon we will start saving."
"KNM-1","H2","My wellbeing has changed for better because I am trained to do farming job to some extent. At the same time I am setteld. I have no problem in fulfilling of my basic needs. Due to experience which I have learned from life I am capable of continuing vegetable farming."
"KNM-1","H4","We are living together. Family relationship is cooperative among and we support each other. We  share what we have and what we earn. Each of us are doing our job and so we have a hope for the best in the future."
"KNM-1","I1a","Important link to Agriculture office - training on vegetable farming: started vegetable farming"
"KNM-22","C5","We use hybrid seeds and fertilizers  which is giving more production these hybrid seeds and fertilizers are commonly used in the community because it gives us more production."
"KNM-22","D6","I kept two piglets to grow as a mother pig and one piglet for selling in this period thus the number of pig has increased. As a result the amount of money by selling pigs and piglets has also increased. At the same time rate of meat has also increased but still I am unable to gain pig's weight as it needs to be provided with dietary foods but I am unable to provide them with such foods."
"KNM-22","E4","Basically extra earning is only from pig farming and surplus food grains remaining from our household consumptions."
"KNM-22","F1","Nowadays we are spending some money on medicines for rearing of pigs and sometimes medicines for family members, and the necessary goods for the household. I spend money for children's education because education is must these days."
"KNM-5","B3","My wife and grandchild become ill frequently. Due to old age, time and again I also become ill. We are constantly visiting  traditional healers and medical doctors. It is expensive and no peace in home as well."
"KNM-5","C3","Nowadays production has increased by use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer. We use machine for ploughing land  and harvesting. Nowadays by use of hybrid seeds amount of production has also increased.  We sell remaining  food grains in the market and from there also we earn to some extent."
"KNM-5","C5","By use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer the production of our crops has increased."
"KNM-5","D2","We feed pigs the food which is available in the market along with waste food products of our home, we call veterinary person when any diseases is seen in pig. I have prepared a shed and I have managed pig farming. However we are following traditional method of breeding pig that our grand parents and parents taught us."
"KNM-5","D6","The reason for this change is because of food that we supply to pig. At the same time price of meat has also increased. Along with income the expenses for rearing pig has also increased. Due to insufficent investment on food we are not able to increase the number of pigs. That is the reason it is hard to get good weight of pig. If we have less pigs then we can afford but we cannot afford on a large scale so we look after what we have and we do not want to increase the number of pigs."
"KNM-5","E1","One of my son is earning abroad so he sends some remittance occasionally. Another son and daughter in law has started tailoring business besides that the income from pig farming is also there."
"KNM-5","E2","It has changed since last five years due to remittance money. Now my children are earning as well. But I have not being able to work as before. I don’t have any income of mine but earning of children and daughter in law is contributing to family expenses. This has changed over he period of time. Previously I was only who did all the work but now we have children supporting us."
"KNM-5","E4","The proportion of money earned from different sources has increased compared to past. At the same time expenses have also increased but still its ok. These days we spend more on consumption in various products that we get from market. But over all we are doing good."
"KNM-5","F1","We spend on education of kids especially for grandchildren's school fees. We also put money for tailoring machine and furniture to establish the tailoring shop. This year we bought a mini tractor which will help us in ploughing field and will save our time. Earlier I used to manage all the expenses by myself but now I have handover to son. So compared to five years ago we have added to accets for furhter income generation."
"KNM-5","F3","Personally for me, now I am not able to manage the income and expenses and I have handed over to my son. Now I just stay at home and care the grand children. All the decisions and payments is made by my sons now. So personally for me my responsibility as well as earning had decreased but not of the household."
"KNM-5","F5","I transfer all responsibility to my children now I don’t look after anything so I am not much sure about the control."
"KNM-5","F8","Recently we have  purchased land, we invested on tailoring shop and mini tractor but regarding saving my son knows everything I am unknown about this. I mean we have added to property and that too is saving only."
"KNM-5","G1","Earlier there used to be  some kind of conflict in my household. We were in joint family and we lived together with brother so there was issues. Now we are separated. Now we have good relations within the family members. By mutual understanding and sharing we work together."
"KNM-5","H2","Personally for me I am not good nowadays, I am getting everything what I wanted but due to age factor, time and again health become so poor. I don’t think my wellbeing is good in that sense. But at household level we are doing good in terms of income generation and to manage livelihood means."
"KNM-5","H4","Now our income as a whole family is good. Children are doing their own work, they are supporting us at each and every aspect. Son and daughter in law takes care of us and they love us. It is great. I am getting food and other things od my choice withough putting too much of effort. My kids do it for me."
"DNF-3","C1","We are cultivating maize, pulses, beans for many generations. Tomato is a new product. We have some hens in our house. Earlier we used locally produced seed but nowadays we are farming with hybrid seed. So proportionally the amount of maize that we produce has increased."
"DNF-3","C3","We are getting some money from selling tomato and the crops which we don't consume at home. So income from agriculture sector is increasing. But not to a large extent because we don’t have any collection centre so we are forced to sells our products through the agents. This year we had loss as the selling price of tomato was so low.  We also sell hen in the local market which is a good income for us."
"DNF-3","C5","We all are suffering from global warming. We farmer is suffering the most from it. The season is changing but our farming pattern is the same. We are not getting benefit from the agriculture sector. What we used to produce earlier for consumption, we are not being able to grow to that extent. Similarly, while we are using fertilizer and hybrid seeds investment in production has increased. But for our home consumption, we never use fertilizer."
"DNF-3","D6","We keep pigs because pigs are needed to sacrifice in every occasion. Most of our piglets are sacrificed for the religious purpose. We did not pay more attention in pig rather we are busy on other work. At a time of feeding, we serve them. As the price of pig meat has increased so while selling pigs we get a good price. I don't think that nowadays our pig's weight is increasing it is same what we used to have earlier."
"DNF-3","E1","My father goes for labour work. We sell tomato  and hens from this we are earning money."
"DNF-3","E4","Yes, the amount of money that our household earns from different activities has increased. As my father goes for labour work. We sell tomato in its season.  We cultivate maize and pulses by taking land on rent. So at the time of good production, we sell them. Beside this, we have kept some hens in our home which is also our source of income."
"DNF-3","F1","We spend most of our income on education and medicines, rice and religious events. We have to also pay for the electric bill,  cable bill, water bill and so on. Earlier it was less expensive. Even education was less expensive when we were small, but now higher the level of education higher is the cost. At the same time, the cost of rice has also increased. Frequently we have to take mother to the hospital where also we need money for various tests. Along with time we have to spend on religious purpose too. Upon the death of the nearest person, we have to spend a lot."
"DNF-3","F8","No, I  do not have any saving. Rather we have taken loan for education. We cannot afford to buy any land. We take others land for cultivation where we have to pay rent."
"DNF-13","C3","No change regarding the income from farming activities. We produce the same crops since long time. We sell the grains which we do not consume in our home. Also, we sell goats and hens. Fluctuation of price is another reason for no change in amount of earning. For example before we used to sell tomato of RS 50 per kg. now this year we sell at RS 5 per kg so there is heavy loss."
"DNF-13","D2","We used to keep mother pig and sell piglet. We don’t adopt any new method in farming pigs and piglets. What we know and see regarding pigs and piglets we are using the same method.  Nowadays Piglet is also suffering from diarrhoea thus we have to call the veterinary doctor and spend more on medicine."
"DNF-13","E1","We sell hens when it grows enough. Sometimes we sell milk product. Similarly, we sell goats and beside that father has gone abroad and he is sending remittances to us."
"DNF-13","E4","What we had been doing in the past, we are continuing the same. Only the change in family income is through father's work in abroad. He has gone abroad and he sends some remittances.  The other source of income is through selling of grains and pet animals hence price is not predictable. Thus the earning is also not predictable, it fluctuates each year. Hence I am not sure regarding earning."
"DNF-13","H4","With the means of education, we regard our family as having wellbeing in the family. But with regard to income, I am not feeling as a well-settled family. We don’t have saving and if we don’t have money so no well-being."
"DNF-9","D6","We have one mother pig which we use to breed piglet. But we don’t have money to buy dietary food for pig so we feed them with our waste food due to which there is no change in weight of pig. This year we had 8 pigs and one mother pig for worship ceremony. We needed to buy other piglets including our piglets so the number of pig had decreased to two. Also while selling pigs there is no profit all the money we got from pig is used on pig farming."
"DNF-9","E1","Regarding income, we are fully depended on remittance from my husband. We do agriculture which is for self-consumption only. It is not enough sometimes  we need to buy food items."
"DNF-9","E2","The main source of income is remittance. Besides that, we also do agriculture work with pig breeding but the income is not sufficient from agriculture and pig breeding."
"DNF-9","E4","We don’t have other income source than remittance, we are fully depended on remittances."
"DNF-7","C1","We used to do maize and tomato farming but monkey and deer destroy our harvest as our land is near to forest. So we have left agriculture work."
"DNF-7","C3","As monkey and deer used to destroy our crops we left agriculture work."
"DNF-7","C5","We don’t do agriculture any more."
"DNF-7","D2","Pigs used to die more often so we don’t keep pigs for a  business purpose rather we rear them to worship for god. There is no earning from pig. Quite a few of our pig died. We don’t know why so we left pig farming. But these days we have 4 pigs because our worship ceremony will held this year."
"DNF-7","D6","It is difficult to gain weight of pigs as we are not able to feed them with proper food. But this time we had to increase the number of pigs as a worship ceremony is coming. There is no profit from pig farming."
"DNF-7","E1","We have a building at Dhankuta main market. From tenants we get some rent. We  also have a  book shop. Similarly  my son and daughter work in Kathmandu."
"DNF-7","E2","We are now earning from other sector rather then pig and agriculture farming."
"DNF-7","E4","Now we have book shop. We collect rent from tenants. My son and daughter also earn in Kathmandu."
"DNF-7","F1","We spend on food, medicine, pig's medicine, clothing, education. There is no change in spending. Before also we used to spend on agriculture work but now we don’t do agriculture so we don’t spend on agriculture anymore."
"DNF-7","F3","Now we have good income from shop, tenants and also son and daughter's income. So we have saved money."
"DNF-7","F5","We are more conscious on spending and saving. So we are controlling money and saving for better tomorrow. As a head of the household, I take all the decisions and control money."
"DNF-7","F8","Saving is done from shop and sons and daughters income rather then agriculture and pig rearing. But we haven't bought any assets"
"DNF-7","H2","Before it used to be depressing because our agriculture used to get destroyed by monkey and deer. It would be only our hard labour but no production. Also pigs used to die with no reason. But now its good we have left agriculture and had established bookshop, collect rent from tenants and also sons and daughter have good income in capital city. We are better off now."
"DNF-7","H4","As we have saved now and also live with bonding. And we do all the works on a shared basis so our wellbeing is better. All the family member are busy in their own work."
"DNF-6","C3","There is no change in the pattern of farming. The only change what we have adopted is that we have started to cultivate cash crops like cucumber and tomato. At the same time, cost of fertilizer have also increased. So we don’t have enough earning from tomato and cucumber. Similarly, we don't have a collection centre so we have to sell through the agent and they usually don't pay us as per market price."
"DNF-6","C5","Earlier what we produced in our land was not sufficient for us. Now we started to grow cash crops. Due to this reason the proportion of land where we cultivated other good grains has decreased. Thus we have to buy most of the thing from the market for consumption."
"DNF-6","D6","The income is dependent on the number of piglet deliver at a time. And it also depends on the type of breed. But we don't have a good species of breed thus we are not getting the high number of pigs and good weight of pigs. Having said that  the market price of meat is increasing day by day thus the amount of earning from a pig is quite good compared  to the past."
"DNF-6","E1","I sell tomato and cucumber from where I get some money. Beside this husband send us remittance."
"DNF-6","E2","Earlier there were limited varieties when it cam to harvesting and it was limited to staple crops mainly used within household consumption. But now we have started cash crops like tomato and cucumber. Earlier husband used to work as labour, now he has gone to Oman and sends remittance which is our household earning."
"DNF-6","E4","Earlier our income was dependent on labour works and agriculture production. Now remittance is another source of money. Apart from farming activities."
"DNF-6","F1","I spend most of our income on food, clothes and children's education. I pay interest of  the loan which we have taken. Similarly, I spend more on different occasions and religious ceremony."
"DNF-6","F3","Due to increase in income, now I can spend more on the household purpose.  Earlier we even had to control money for eating food and wearing good clothes, but now on this issue we are not facing any problem. Along with income, the expenses are increasing parallels. Along increasingly expenses on children is increasing in every sector like education, food, entertainment sector and so on."
"DNF-6","F5","Earlier husband used to take all the decisions regarding expenditure, but now I manage all the income and expenses. I make all decisions on where to spend money."
"DNF-6","F8","Until now we don’t have any saving, rather we have borrowed loan while my husband was going  abroad. Until today we have not purchased any assets."
"DNF-6","G1","We have a good relationship among the family member. Now I am taking all the decision regarding expenses. Still, at the time of the important decision, I call my husband and take action."
"DNF-6","H2","At the time of  marriage I had suffered a lot in this house. I had to work hard and I didn't have any money. Now I work in the field from where I earn some money. Now I am clearing the loan. I am free to do what ever I like so I am happy now a days."
"DNF-6","H4","Earlier  even we had difficulties to have rice in our meal. But now we earn some money. Along with this we are providing a quality education for the children. Earlier we had lots of loan. Now we are clearing them and only a part of it is left.  After some year we will have some saving too."
"DNF-17","D6","I don’t know about the weight of pigs as we don’t take weight of pigs. We sell them by seeing its body. At the same time most of the time we basically consume pigs in our home especially during various ceremony and religious occasions. We breed in home so we cannot say the actual number. Some time it may be more sometime it may be less but the money from pig have been increased as we sell lots of piglets. Still the money from pig is sufficient for pigs only."
"DNF-17","E1","We sell tomato in the market. Beside that, we sell goats, hen, piglets and buffalo also. Remittance is another source of our family income."
"DNF-17","E2","In the last five years, the change in activities for income is only through the means of remittance. We are getting more money from remittance than farming here. Now we are also planning to plant fruits (Orange and lemon)."
"DNF-17","E4","From the means of remittance."
"DNF-17","F3","I arrange all the household goods as brothers are living in the city and father and mother are old enough. Earlier father used to takes responsibility regarding household, now the pressure comes on my head."
"DNF-17","F5","Yes, I look at all the family income and expenditure. So I take all the decisions regarding spending. I don’t spend money on other things than we need."
"DNF-17","F8","Yes, we have some saving nowadays. My brother have purchased a motorbike. At the same time, we spend a lot of money for operation and while brother has gone abroad."
"DNF-17","H2","I am happy with what I have and what I am doing. I am caring for my family members and participate in community work so I consider my self as having good a wellbeing."
"DNF-17","H4","All of the family members are busy in their own work. These days we have some saving too. We are earning money through which we are providing a good education to the children. So everything is going well."
"DYF-1","A13","Father in law died in this period, thus my husband returned from abroad. Everything is going wrong since the death of my father in law. We are going through a bad period."
"DYF-1","B1","Recently father in law died. My husband is the  only  son in the family. So he had to perform all the rituals hence he returned back from abroad to complete  all the rituals."
"DYF-1","C1","We are farming tomato, maize and beans. Beside this, we have two cows, 5 pigs and 3 hens. We are doing the traditional way of farming. Until now we have not adopted any new technology on farming. Now farming is being difficult because of high labour cost, low production and change in seasonal climatic abruptions."
"DYF-1","D6","Usually we don’t sell pig. Most of the pigs are consumed during religious ceremonies. Remaining piglets we sell. As cost for rearing pig is high so we do not raise it to let pigs become mature. Thus income is determined by the number of piglets born at a time."
"DYF-1","E1","Husband has gone abroad but now he has returned back due to death of father in law. Beside this, we sell tomato, beans, milk products and hen. Apart from that my husband sometime goes for labour work as well."
"DYF-1","E4","No change at all. Earlier remittance used to be the sources of income. Now, this has  also stopped. So only animal rearing is thee source of income."
"DYF-1","F3","Father - in - law's death ritual ceremony cost a lot of money. In Rai culture we have to perform a lot of rituals to perform death rites. At the time when husband left for abroad we had to spend a lots of money to send him for work in processing charge."
"DYF-1","F5","For some year I have taken all the responsibility regarding income and expenses as my husband was in abroad. Now he manages all the income and expenses."
"DYF-1","F8","We had borrowed loan for father in laws death rituals. At the same time we already debts while my husband has gone abroad. When the father in law was active he even sold a piece of land. So in fact we have instead adding property we have lost in the last five years."
"DYF-1","H2","What we earn is not sufficient for food itself. We have to return the loan with interest. So we are in trouble really."
"DYF-1","H4","Due to emergency, husband had to return from abroad. There also he did not get good wages. We have a lot of loans, and we have no other income source. Expenses is increasing day by day. Even for a year father in laws ritual have to continue."
"DYF-10","A13","We are working very hard. My father is a retired army. He wants to do pig farming in a modern way but none of the banks provide loan for farming. Now my brother have migrated to Kathmandu for a education."
"DYF-10","C1","We have farming of avocado and banana.  Beside that, we cultivate spinach, bean, maize for self- consumption. Avocado has been a new experience of farming for us. Once while we had visited Kathmandu there we saw the avocado plant.  Later agriculture cooperative provided us with its plant.  We are interested in it due to  its market value. Also we have some hen, buffalo and goats that too at times give income."
"DYF-10","C3","Before we used to do tomato farming but now we have stopped it. Now we are farming avocado so it has been 4 years but this year only it have started giving fruits. Other grain which we farm is sufficient for pets and for household consumption. The income from pets is sufficient for ensuring food from them. The only benefit is that when we sell it we get money in lump sum."
"DYF-10","C5","The harvest that we cultivate for self-consumption, we do not use any fertilizer so we have low production.  Due to low production, we have to purchase a lot of food items including grain. In the meantime, due to plantation of tree at the boundary of the field and the shade of the tree, the production is further low."
"DYF-10","H2","First of all I have got good education and I have proper understanding of family. Every family member understands and respects each others feelings. We perform a task in coordination. I am happy with what we have. So over all we are better off comparatively."
"DYF-10","H4","Peace, harmony, cooperation in the family makes me happy and that is our family wellbeing. We all are living happily. We have a saving too so in a time of emergency also we need not to ask others for money."
"DYF-8","B1","All children have migrated to Kathmandu for grand children's better education and for employment. We two are only living here."
"DYF-8","C1","Now we are farming only a certain portion of land. Before we used to take others land on rent now we have stopped doing it as children have migrated to Kathmandu now."
"DYF-8","C3","We two husbands and wife are not able to work a lot. Thus we left most of the farming that we cultivated. Now we do only for self-consumption purposes."
"DYF-8","C5","We have reduced the proportion of farming that we used to cultivate previously. We are not able to work hard on filed. My sons and daughter are busy on their own work. So we produce less these days and that is too for self-consumption."
"DYF-8","D6","Pigs farming gives quite a good income but it requires hard work. If we are able to feed them on time with good food we can maximize the profit. At the same time if we are able to arrange a good breed of pig then the piglets will be high in numbers and even healthy too. In 6 months time period, we get a good price. But the problem is that it is difficult to feed them proper food on time. It is also tough to keep them clean to make it disease free."
"DYF-8","E1","At the time of the visit, children used to give us  some money. Beside this, we sell piglets with that income we are surviving."
"DYF-8","E2","I don’t have any income. We are totally depended on children. And occasionally we sell piglets."
"DYF-8","E4","We are dependent on children. We two can not  go for labour work as we are old enough for labour work."
"DYF-8","F1","We spend what we need to on medical purpose, travelling and food. Nowadays spending on medical purpose is high. On household spending nothing much had changed."
"DYF-8","F3","we are not earning anything now. So our expenses is also low. Substantive expenditure go to medicine. On food item we do not spend much."
"DYF-8","H2","I am suffering from stomach pain. Husband also being older cannot do hard work and have to depend on children."
"DYF-16","B3","Previously I was having muscle pain. I had problems in moving and working but now I am feeling better. Now father in law is suffering from illness time and again due to old age. But my health has improved."
"DYF-16","C3","At present what we grow in the field is more than enough for us. So we sell all the extra produce especially grain and vegetables in the market. We can sell it in Dhankutta market. Also nowadays the price of things has gone up and therefore there is an increased amount. And thus the amount of household income has also increased."
"DYF-16","C5","Due to a change in the seasonal pattern  especially climatic abruptions, production rate is comparatively low. Earlier except rice, we used to produce all the goods needed for us. But nowadays we purchase various goods from the market too. We also don’t have enough water supply for own self so there is always lack of water for our crops as well. This is an issue that has adversely affected our production."
"DYF-16","D6","For the piglets, we feed the food with vitamins that is available in the market which helps in increasing weight and helps piglet to grow faster. Most of the pig we consume by self. We rarely sell the pig. Rather we sell piglet. We are not rearing pig for sale rather for self-consumption. Thus we don't calculate the earning from the pig."
"DYF-16","E1","My husband is present ward chairperson. Thus his salary and allowance is the main source of income these days. Beside that, we sell hens, goats, some grains that adds to household earning."
"DYF-16","E2","I am a farmer thus what I grow I sell that in the market and that is my income. Nothing has changed in this period especially in the last five years as I have not changed the pattern of cultivation. I sell  pets sometime. The only change is that my husband is political representative of the village."
"DYF-16","E4","Salary of my husband, selling of pulses, maize and beans. We also sell milk product sometime. Beside this we sell hens, goat, piglet which has added to the increase of the amount of money in my household."
"DYF-16","F3","I manage all household expenses. What I sell in the market I take money by myself. Beside that husband give me what he earns. So nowadays I decide what to buy but earlier husband used to take all decisions. Husband is busy in village issues really."
"DYF-16","F8","I have saved some money in various women's group and even in a bank. But we don’t have purchased any assets. My husband is planning to do investment in other sector rather than agriculture."
"DYF-16","G1","We together take a decision regarding household expenses. While selling pets and grain, I decide myself and fixed the price of our goods. Earlier my husband was taking interest in selling things but after he being elected as ward chair all household related decision is taken by me."
"DYF-16","H2","I am happy. Nowadays we don’t have a problem with eating and clothing. We all are doing our own job. My husband is elected as a ward chairperson so everything is going well. The most important thing is now I  am healthy."
"DYF-16","H4","We all are living happily. We share with each other. We have a feeling of togetherness in the community. We have some saving we don’t have any problem."
"DYF-19","C1","Now we are farming lemon, maize and tomato. But maize is destroyed by monkey and deer. From tomato, we are not getting satisfactory price so we started farming lemon instead of tomato."
"DYF-19","C3","As our crops often are destroyed by monkey and deer and also this year we had great loss on tomato. We sold tomato low price. There was loss in this."
"DYF-19","C5","It is very difficult to continue farming in tis area due to wild animals destruction. We have left large chunk of land unfarmed because of monkey and deer they often come and destroy our crops."
"DYF-19","D2","We left pig farming because we were not getting benefit from it."
"DYF-19","D6","What we serve them is the waste food from our home which is the main reason that they don’t get weight so now we have left farming pigs. At the same time, no one is supporting us and also here there are no good species of breed too."
"DYF-19","E1","We are earning from labour work of husband, remittance and from lemon and tomato, but this year we had loss in tomato."
"DYF-19","E2","Yes I have started lemon farming."
"DYF-19","E4","Income has increased due to remittance money and labour work. Compared to five years ago earning  of the household has increased. Now we are focusing on products that has a market and this thinking was not there five years ago."
"DYF-19","F1","We have to buy most of the thing in household. We have to spend on education, foods, TV channels, phone charge and so on."
"DYF-19","F3","Altogether we have a good family earning. All family member give money to me and I spend on what we need to."
"DYF-19","F8","`"
"DYF-19","H2","Now, husband earns from labour work. We are getting remittance money also. Now from lemon farming we are getting some good amount of money. Beside that health condition of all of us is good. We all respect each other. I see all the family member happy, personally, I am also happy. No complains."
"DYF-19","H4","
Everybody is doing their part of work. We take a decision on sharing basis. We have some saving too. So we can afford our children a quality education. This is something that is adding to our confidence. This is the real change in the last five years."
"DYF-5","B1","One son is separated now. Both of them has gone abroad now and they are earning."
"DYF-5","B3","I have leg pain but I am not taking it seriously. It may be because of growing towards old age. We visit the hospital when we suffer sickness."
"DYF-5","C3","Now maize is damaged by monkey.  lentil is destroyed by deer. And also due to the market problem, we are not getting any profit and this year we had to bear loss on our investment as we had to sell tomato on so low price that we even didn’t get our investment."
"DYF-5","C5","We have production but no direct market so we are not getting any profit instead this year we had to bear loss."
"DYF-5","D2","We used to breed pig for veterinary and sell the piglet but now I am not doing it. Also some piglet is kept for worship and rituals. This is basically offering sacrifice to god for the good health of the family members and better production in the field."
"DYF-5","E1","My son has gone abroad so he sends remittance. From agriculture some time we earn whereas some time we bear all loss. Piglet also sold on low price as we have only local breed which is most common in the village so we don’t get paid more."
