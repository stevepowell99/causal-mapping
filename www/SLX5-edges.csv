17,18,NA,0.5,0.5,1,▶,NA,"In my view the main factor to success relies on the the council prioritising this extension over other planned cycling routes.  NS council are currently working on multiple cycling schemes across the whole county, which is a good thing, however they only have limited time, resources and money. Therefore our role needs to focus on activities such as petition, raising awareness and local support, continued pressure on the council to increase focus & priority on this extension above others. Once the extension is in place it will have multiple positive effects on the local communities in both Yatton and Clevedon. By offering a safe cycling route it will open up access for Clevedon residents to the train station, it will encourage residents of both towns to have more options for local leisure activities with their family instead of having to get in the car, it will increase fitness and well being of local residents, will bring more business revenue into both towns as people will stay local and it will have a positive effect on the environment as it will help reduce carbon footprint of local car journeys and provide an extension to the wildlife corridor of the existing Strawberry line.",NA,NA,NA,NA
