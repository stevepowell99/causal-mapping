The line is completely safe, takes us through the beautiful countryside and is a wonderful experience but the preparation time and effort required means that we dont do the trip nearly as often as we would if the link from Clevedon to Yatton was present. <br /><br />I would be delighted to see the line reopen for cycling and walkers between Clevedon and Yatton and possibly even onwards to Portishead. It would undoubtedly be beneficial for commuters to connect to the rail network and also promote better health and countryside education through recreational use.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,267,263
"Ive used the Strawberry Line many times from Yatton. Even once getting a puncture mid ride, much nicer to walk back on the Strawberry Line than busy roads! However, having to drive to Yatton from Clevedon is a real shame when we could all be saving on driving, improving our environment and travelling further by bike",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,268,264
"Access to the rail network without having to use fuel burning, carbon spewing motor transport would be really helpful. The B3133 is far too dangerous to cycle, especially in low light conditions and poor weather.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,269,265
i love to cycle the strawberry line and elsewhere that is safe not only for me but my kids. it would be wonderful to connect with clevedon and the seafront and centre. no brainer!!  ;-),1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,270,266
Would like a safe route to get to Yatton as have family there and try not to use the car if possible.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,271,267
"The strawberry line is a great path. And a longer path will be even better. Commuters tourists learning to cycle, returning to cycling. Walkers love it too for similar reasons. And mobility scooters. And runners. And dog walkers.  Charity events. Etc",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,272,268
"I moved to Clevedon in 2016 having lived in Bristol and cycled to work in the city.  I would like to continue that exercise and routine but I now find that all routes between Clevedon and Yatton Station are unpleasant and dangerous for cyclists.  I would also like to be a positive roll model for my 2 year old son by cycling to and from Yatton Station but find that the benefit of being that roll model is outweighed by the risk to my life as a cyclist.  I know because I am now one of the car commuters who drives between Clevedon and Yatton Station and I have seen several near misses in the two years that I have been driving the route.  By extending the Strawberry Line to Clevedon I would remove a car from the road, thereby helping the environment; I would set a good example to my son and I would be a healthier person and therefore less likely to be a drain on the NHS.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,273,269
I need a cycle path from Clevedon to Yatton to enable me to link up with the train station in Yatton in order to commute to work.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,274,270
"I am a founder member of a local cycling recreational group who regularly use the Strawberry Line from Cheddar to Yatton. The path is not long enough for a decent-length ride so we often extend it to Clevedon, often to the craft centre where there is a caf. However the roads from Yatton to  Clevedon that we have to use are very long and straight and are also used by a considerable number of  fast-moving cars, some of which are clearly exceeding the speed limit. Extension of the line to Clevedon would make our day's riding much more enjoyable and much less dangerous and unpleasant.",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,275,271
I cycle twice a day between  Congresbury and Clevedon - up to Yatton down the Strawberry Line no problem ( safe no vehicles ) then !!  Lorries tractors etc - this new extension of the route will save cyclists lots of hassle and also encourage other to take up cycling to school/work and for pleasure.,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,276,272
I live in Clevedon and it would be great to cycle the line from here with my family as the road to yatton is very dangerous on a bike,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,277,273
"We should be encouraging everyone to enjoy the outdoors and keep fit. Cycling is a great family activity but the road between Clevedon to Yatton is narrow, winding and busy (and dangerous for cyclists). That's why a cycle path is needed!",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,278,274
"There are only 2 routes by bike to Clevedon. 1 route takes you along a 60mph road. The other is 40mph with very little opportunity for cars to overtake. There is also a very poor bus service to Clevedon from Yatton (despite Yatton being the train station for Clevedon). If the path was extended, Yatton village would be able to access shops, cinema and the coast without the need for cars. Less cars on the road would result in a safer environment. More bicycles and walking would result in better health outcomes and better quality of life. Young people would have more work opportunities if Clevedon could be accessible safely by bike. It would make family life better.",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,279,275
